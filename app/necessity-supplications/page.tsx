      "In the case of possibility, it is obligatory on us to keep ourselves from loss. On the other hand, every person certainly faces loss in this world. This is because each one of us comes across such issues which engage our minds, disturb our thoughts and harm us. These issues either emerge from our inner-self, such as a stimulus that causes our body to fall sick, or from an external stimulus such as the oppression of the oppressors, and those unpleasant things that we suffer from our neighbours and partners.\n\nIf someone is not suffering from these losses at present, then his intellect indicates towards the possibility of its occurrence in the future. How can we deny this reality while humans live in an accident prone atmosphere and this place never remains in one condition constantly and its difficulties cannot be separated from it?\n\nTherefore, the worldly calamities have certainly affected the human life or will affect him. And in the case of possibility and ability, we should remove each of them. It is with supplications that such an ability is achieved. Because supplications are in the boundaries of our ability, a man should regularly supplicate irrespective of his condition.",

Supplications benefit us either by the removal of such calamities that have occurred or by distancing the evil that has reached us, or for the purpose of achieving a profit or benefit that we desire; or for the purpose of stabilizing, preserving and preventing our good things from destruction.\n\nThis is because our Holy Leaders (A.S.) have described Duaa (supplication) using the word Silaah (armour), and Silaah is a means of benefit and elimination of loss. Similarly, they have described supplication with the word Turs (shield), and Turs is something that stops the undesirable things from reaching a person.",

      '"After we have clarified the necessity for offering prayer for the leader of the time (may our soul be sacrificed for him) it is compulsory for us not to focus our intention when supplicating only to reach some prestige rather we should pray to God seeking for His pleasure, nearness to Him and the awaiting leader (peace be upon him). Then you should be aware of this matter."\n\nSayyid Ashsharafi (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n\n"We do travel to different countries for the purpose of propagating Islam. In one of our journeys which was very close to the holy month of Ramadan, I was along with some of my friends under the service of Hajj Sheikh Rajab Ali Al-Khayyat, we demanded him to teach and admonish us, he taught us how to use this holy verse: {And whosoever fears God}"\n\n"He said: we should first give alms (sadaqah), fast for forty days and recite the verse while fasting. In a nutshell what was important in his explanation (may Allah raise his position) is as follows: This duty must be with the intention of nearness to the eighth Imam (peace be upon him) and should not be done seeking for materials."\n\nSayyid Ashsharafi said:\n\n"I commenced the assignment but was not able to conclude it while I stopped, but my friend completed the assignment and he later travelled to the holy city of Mash\'had to visit Imam Ali Rida, the eighth Imam (peace be upon him) and saw him in a form of light and after a while he was able to witness and talk with the Imam (peace be upon him)."\n\nIt is then incumbent upon anybody that offers prayers not to misuse the opportunity rather he should offer his prayers as worship without interfering in the issues concerning God and should not try to attract people to himself.',
