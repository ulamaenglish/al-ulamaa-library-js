NIGHT PRAYERS

A: If it is not achieved by taking efforts at reciting the last verse of Sura Kahf, then it should be offered in the first half of the night (i.e. before midnight).

A: Recite Salawat a lot and present them to him, along with praying for the hastening of his reappearance. In addition, go to Masjid Jamkaran a lot

BELIEF AND CERTAINTY
Belief and certainty of believers has degrees, and it is possible for one to reach the stage of witnessing from the higher stages of belief, and for his certainty to increase.

SPIRITUAL ASPIRATIONS AND ENLIGHTENMENT
Why are we not like butterflies, flying in search of spiritual light?

SUPPLICATIONS AND INVOCATIONS
In plights and afflictions, this is the best Zikr (Invocation) that we have received from the Prophet, peace be upon him and his progeny, "La hawla walā quwwata illā billāh al-‘Alī al-āzīm, lā malja'a walā manja'a min Allāhi illā ilayh."

REPELLING AFFLICTIONS
For the repelling of afflictions, this supplication is also useful: "Allāhumma Sali ‘alā Muhammad wa ‘āli Muhammad wa amsik ‘annā al-sū’." (O God, send blessings on Mohammad and his descendants and keep evils aloof from us!)

EYE HEALTH
In order to keep one’s eyes healthy, Ayat al-Kursi should be recited after prayers, following which, one must put his hands on his eyes and say, "Allāhumma ihfaz hadaqatayya bihaqqi hadaqatay ‘Alī bin Abi Ṭālib Amīr al-Mu’minīn ‘alayhi as-salām." (O God, protect my two eyes for the sake of the two eyes of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him!)

CURING THE SICK
For curing the sick, the water of Zamzam and the soil of Karbala should be given to him several times, Sadaqah should be given several times to different people, even if the value is not much; Sura al-Hamd should be recited between one to hundred times by different people. These are very effective. In addition to these, the ill person must ask his friends to pray for him.

PROTECTION AND SAFETY
In order to remain safe, recite the following three times every morning and evening: "Allāhuma ‘ij‘al fī dir‘ika al-hasīnati allatī taj‘alu fīhā man turīdu." (O God, keep me in your strong, protective armor wherein you keep those whom you intend to!)

FINDING LOST OR STOLEN ITEMS
For finding the lost or stolen things, even if it may be a person, recite this Zikr a lot: "Asbahtu fī amānillah, amsaytu fī jawārillah." (I started my day in the protection of God, my night began in the protection of God).

INCREASE IN SUSTENANCE
One who wants an increase in his sustenance should recite the following Zikr a lot, with a Salawat in the beginning and end: "Allahumma aghninī bihalālika ‘an harāmika wa bifaḍlika ‘a man siwāk." (O God, make me needless of your Haram (unlawful) through your Halal (lawful), and from all other than you through your bounties and mercy.)

ROLE OF THE QUR'AN
Qur'an is a book that can train Prophets, for Prophets are of two kinds: Those that are designated to Prophethood by God, And the ‘Prophets of Perfection’ that acquire the perfections of the prophets as a result of their beliefs, and acting upon the commands of the Qur’an. Based on this, the Qur’an trains prophets of perfection.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS THE QUR'AN
We have the responsibility of striving to learn, teach, recite, and act upon the Qur’an. However, whilst we place the Qur’an upon our heads on the nights of vigil [i.e. the Nights of Power], in practice, we step upon the verses of hijab, backbiting, lying and the verses, "Woe to the defrauders,"[Surah al-Mutaffifeen (83): 1] "Do not speak to your parents in an ill-tempered manner,"[Surah al-Israa (17): 23] and "Do not walk exultantly on the earth."[Surah al-Israa (17): 37]

RECITATION OF SUPPLICATIONS
The supplications reported for specific places and times are not restricted such that they cannot be recited at other places or times; in fact, these instructions are desirable in multiplicity.

RESPECT FOR THE QUR'AN
We must have absolute certainty in the fact that looking at the Qur'an is not like looking at any other book.

THE QUR'AN'S UNIQUE BLESSINGS
No nation has been blessed with such a Qur'an that has all these distinctions and effects! A blessing of this greatness has been bestowed upon us, but it is as though they have not granted us (anything), and as though this book is not complementary to man!

BENEFITS OF TAWASSUL WITH THE QUR'AN
Tawassul (seeking intersession) with the Qur'an, carrying, understanding, and reciting it, is beneficial for the salvation of even the common public, let alone the elite!

VALUE OF THE QUR'AN VS. HUMAN SPEECHES
Its a wonder that so much attention is paid to personalities and their words, and that their speeches are recorded, whilst the Quran, which is in our hands, does not hold such value before us! We all are aware that we are culpable with regards to the Quran.

CLARIFICATION AND REVELATION OF THE QUR'AN
One who follows the fact that Quran is a clarification of all things,’ shall see strange and unusual (things).

DIVINE NATURE OF THE QUR'AN
Do we have the faintest idea that the Quran is not like other writings! It is as though the Quran is a Divine Existence from the realm of light and spirituality, and has appeared in the corporeal realm.

WEAKNESS IN CERTITUDE
If we do not benefit from the Quran, it is because there is weakness in our certitude.

ROLE OF MEMORIZING THE QUR'AN
God knows best the role of memorizing the Quran in being able to derive benefit from this treasure and source of divine mercy [...] We do not benefit from the Quran as we ought to!

QUR'AN'S POWER AND CAPABILITIES
'If only it were a Quran whereby the mountains could be moved, or the earth could be toured, or the dead could be spoken to…'[Surah al-Ra‘d (13): 31] What is it saying?! Are the affairs mentioned in this verse impossible and unrealistic? Or is the verse saying that the people of the Qur'an can do all of these through the Qur'an?!

PONDERING OVER THE QUR'AN
He is acquainted with the Quran who ponders more over it; the Ahadith are just like the Quran.

THE QUR'AN AS A COMPLETE WEAPON
If we are right in saying that the Quran is a weapon, then what need do we have for another weapon!

THE QUR'AN'S ROLE IN HUMAN PERFECTION
Quran takes man to the epitome of human perfection. We do not appreciate the Quran and its equal, Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them.

THE QUR'AN'S IMAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL
If there was a book that showed an image of things, then such a book is the Quran that shows the image of heaven and hell.

MIRACLES OF THE QUR'AN
God knows best what miracles the Quran has for the believers, especially if they are men of knowledge, and what things they would see through it!

SEEING THE QUR'AN IN ITS TRUE FORM
Only if we were to see the Quran in its real form would it become clear if we are able to distinguish our hands from an orange.

THE QUR'AN AS A SELF-DEVELOPMENT TOOL
The Quran is the last program of self-development that has been placed at our disposal, but we don’t appreciate it!

ATTRACTING OTHERS TO ISLAM THROUGH THE QUR'AN
If we would act upon the Quran, we would attract others to Islam and the Qur'an, because the Qur'an is inclusive of all the perfections of the ‘Ulu al-‘Azm Anbiya (the resolute amongst the Prophets), peace be upon them.

ATTRACTING OTHERS THROUGH ACTIONS
If we would truly act upon the Quran, we would attract others through our actions, because most people, apart from a very few, are seekers of light.

GOD'S TEACHINGS TO THOSE WHO ACT UPON KNOWLEDGE
One who acts upon his knowledge, God teaches him that which he does not know!

SERVITUDE AND ABSTINENCE
If this path (servitude and abstinence of sins) was hard to the end, and did not end at ease and desire, it would not have been set up as the responsibility, and cause of encouragement, by the All-Powerful and Benevolent Creator.

ATTENTIVE OBSERVATION (MURAQABAH)
It appears that abstinence from sins in its absolute form (abstaining from all sins) will not take place without permanent attentive observation (muraqabah).

RELIGIOUS GUIDANCE
Let us not look at (follow) each other; rather, look at the book of Religion, and act or abstain in accordance to it.

REMEMBRANCE OF THE TRUE BENEFACTOR
If half of ones life is spent in remembrance of the true benefactor and the other half in ignorance, then half of his life is considered as life and the other half as death.

REMEMBRANCE AND ABSTINENCE FROM SINS
Abstinence from sins is not attained such that it becomes second nature, except through muraqabah and the remembrance of God in every state, time, place, in public and in private.

LOVE FOR IMAM MAHDI AND THE PROPHET
We love Imam Mahdi since he is the Commander of the Bees. All our affairs reach us through him, and the Prophet, peace be upon him and his progeny, has appointed him as our commander. We love the Prophet because God has appointed him as an intercessor between God and us, and we love God because he is the source of all goodness, and the existence of contingent beings is His grace.

SEEKING INTERSESSION THROUGH SPECIFIED MEDIUMS
Seeking intersession with the intermediaries of grace is carried out through its own specified mediums. We must seek their guidance and follow their leadership in order to become successful!

PRACTICAL VS. VERBAL PREACHING
Practical preaching is higher and more effective than verbal preaching.

DAILY RELIGIOUS PRACTICES
It is of the obvious facts that daily recitation of the Quran and supplications appropriate for different times and places following prayers, and elsewhere, increased going to Mosques and Shrines, visiting scholars and the virtuous, and sitting down with them, all please God and his Prophet, peace be upon him and his progeny. We must pay more attention every day to (gaining) better insight and intimacy with worship, recitation (of the Quran) and Ziarah.

JUSTICE AND REVENGE
There does not exist in this world an oppression without revenge for its oppressor.

HIDDEN SPIRITUAL WORLD
Anyone who pays attention, and has insight, will acknowledge that, there is a hidden spiritual world at work beyond this world.

IMPACT OF SIN ON SPIRITUALITY
There were people who, if they committed a sin or mistake, ate impure food, they would realize and say, 'We became dark, a veil has overcome us.'

PURPOSE OF CREATION AND SERVITUDE
The purpose of creation is servitude, 'I did not create the Jinn and Humans except that they may worship Me,'[Surah adh-Dhariyaat (51): 54] and the reality of servitude is refraining from sins in belief, which is the act of the heart, and in acts of the body.

FRIENDSHIP WITH GOD AND INTERMEDIARIES
If we want our perfection, and ourselves we must be Gods friend! And if we are God's friend, we must be the friend of the intermediaries of blessings from the Prophet and his progeny. Thus, the alchemy of prosperity is the remembrance of God, and He is the driving force of the muscles towards the causes of absolute prosperity.

PROCRASTINATION
It is a loss to leave todays duties for tomorrow, for tomorrow will have its own tasks. If today passes, it shall be gone and will not be compensable.

DIVINE ASSISTANCE AND MATERIAL WEALTH
Tawfeeq (divine assistance) has nothing to do with wealth, poverty, sleep, and wakefulness. It sometimes happens that one is wealthy but not successful at doing good, and sometimes even little income is full of grace and blessings.

GUIDANCE THROUGH SERIOUS EFFORT
If one is eager to seek guidance and maarifah (cognizance of God) and is serious and sincere in his demand, with the permission of God, all of creation would become his guide.

WISDOM IN AFFLICTIONS
God never sends afflictions without wisdom; rather, he sends it for us to pray and supplicate. Therefore, for relief from these, supplicating is necessary, and humility at his threshold is desirable.

COMMITMENT TO JURISPRUDENCE AND SPIRITUALITY
Sometimes we do not act upon the explicit and easy commands of jurisprudence that we are already aware of, and then we go to teachers of ethics and spirituality to ask for heavy Zikrs (invocations) and matters heavier and greater than what we need… This indicates that we do not want to progress and reach perfection and higher levels of spirituality through the right path.

INTELLECT AND REASON IN RELIGION
Intellect, reason, perspicacity, and intelligence in mundane and religious affairs help earn the pleasure of God. These understandings rescue man from the disasters of this world and the punishment of the Hereafter!

EXTRAORDINARY DEEDS WITH LITTLE BENEFIT
Sometimes some individuals end up carrying out extraordinarily hard things that others are incapable of carrying out; however, it does not have any remarkable benefit for his fellow-creatures.

ACCEPTING WORLDLY IMPERFECTIONS
It is very rare for someones life to be in line with his desires. All worldly pleasures are accompanied with numerous grievances. If one accepts and looks at the world in this way, he would become less upset because of the evils of his spouse and neighbors, for he would not expect more from this world except that it is a house of afflictions.

KNOWLEDGE VS. WEALTH
The conflicts of men is in their knowledge and ignorance; and the value of men is also in their knowledge, not in their wealth.

IMPORTANCE OF MUSTAHABBAAT
It appears that the reason behind our having fallen behind is in our neglecting Mustahabbaat! Scholars of the past were committed to Mustahabbaat, such as Ziarah, Du’a, recitation of the Qur'an, offering prayers on time, and avoiding the Makruhaat, such as sleeping before sunrise.

STAYING ON THE PATH OF GOD
If we deviate a little from the path, the Satans among men and jinn will take over us. If one finds the path of salvation, he should be sure that this is the goal. We should make a covenant of staying in the path of God, not intending to do wrong, and staying away from the minor sins.

DIVINE GUIDANCE AND EFFORT
Divine Guidance and Jihad of the servants, each has a degree. Each degree of Jihad and effort of the servant brings about a degree of divine guidance.

PROPER RECITATION AND BENEFIT FROM PRAYER
One of the other responsibilities, along with all the other struggles, is to recite the Qur'an in its proper manner (i.e. in the way it is worthy to be read), such that we learn something new in every recitation. We must also benefit from each of our prayers more than before, rather than just repeating it in the same manner without any difference.

CONNECTION TO THE SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE
May it be such that our knowledge and marifah, just like a river that is connected to the sea, remains connected to its source, even if the connection is as thin as a thread. Otherwise, even a pool full of water has no benefit, continuity, and freshness if it is not connected to the springhead.

SEEKING GREATER BEAUTY
One who seeks the greater beauty is oblivious to the lower beauties.

PRAYERS FOR BELIEVERS
He, who wants his prayers to be answered, should pray for the rescue of the believers, so that he may be included in the prayers of angles, which is definitely answered.

MUSTAHAB DEEDS AND SPIRITUALITY
They are the Mustahab deeds that get man to a (spiritual) stage!

NIGHT PRAYERS AND SLEEP
They have not asked us to dig a mountain in our worship; the most difficult part is to offer night prayers, which in reality, requires a change in our sleeping times, not an absolute lack of sleep. Rather, sleep half an hour earlier, so that you wake up half an hour earlier.

CERTAINTY AND SUSTENANCE
May it be such that certainty becomes mans sustenance! How great it is for man to be in peace with regards to the thought of sustenance, for anxiety and worry is worse than the trouble of working. One who is afflicted with worry for his sustenance, works day and night, and is always bothered about it.

SUPPLICATION AND INTERCESSION
During times of difficulty, and for repelling afflictions, one must not let go off supplication and seeking intercession.

AFFLICTIONS AND SINNING
All afflictions occur with our own will; because we abandon the obedience of God and choose sinning with our own desire, we inevitably face its retribution in the form of difficulties and afflictions.

SATISFACTION WITH SELF
May we not become satisfied with ourselves. If we become pleased with ourselves, we will not be able to fulfill the rights of our Lord in His obedience and servitude. Although we are nothing, we consider ourselves as everything.

PESSIMISM ABOUT ONE'S DEEDS
Everyone should be pessimistic about, and have a negative opinion regarding his deeds, before God as well as his own self.

SAVING A LIFE AND RELIGIOUS DEVIATION
God Almighty says, 'Whoever saves a life is as though he had saved all mankind.'[Surah al-Ma’idah (5): 32] The meaning of ‘life’ in this verse is rescuing from deviations and misguidance in religion.

GOD'S PRESENCE AND SINNING
Should we not be in a state of pleading with God because of all these afflictions that befall the Muslims? How should we be if we see God present and a witness everywhere?!... In the presence of a being from whom separation is impossible, and who is present and a witness over us everywhere, how should we be and not commit sins?! The more this perception of presence strengthens, the more protected and safer man would be, and the more it weakens, the lesser his safety and protection would be.

REMEMBRANCE OF GOD AND PEACE
The verse ‘Indeed hearts find rest in Gods remembrance,’ states that the Zikrollah (remembrance of God) is the sole cause of the hearts attaining peace and tranquility, Based on this, can we who do not have peace, claim that we remember Him?

TREATMENT OF ILLNESS
We know the illness, but are not concerned about its treatment. We have identified the medicine too, as the Qur’an says, 'And He inspired man with its virtues and vices,' but we are not concerned about its treatment.

SPIRITUAL DISTANCE
We regret because of having seen scholars that are very different to us (in terms of spirituality), so much so that it feels as though there is a distance of a few hundred years between us and them.

MODESTY AND NEIGHBORLY CARE
Some are so modest that they are not willing to state their needs despite all their poverty and misery! Must neighbors and colleagues not look after such people?

PROPHETS AND REMEMBRANCE OF GOD
Prophets, peace be upon them, dealt with God, and wherever they would face a problem, they would turn to God immediately. They would remember God even during times of happiness, in a way that it was as though they would see God as the source of everything.

ADHERENCE TO SUPPLICATIONS OF AHL AL-BAYT
The first stage of adhering to the supplications of Ahl al-Bayt is to sit down and become familiar with them.

GREED AND CONTENTMENT
One who is filled with some dry bread, or he can live with vegetables, yoghurt and cheese, why does he have all this greed for the world, and the wealth of this world?!

RECOGNIZING ONE'S SICKNESS
We do not consider ourselves sick; else, its treatment is easy.

HALAAL FOOD AND SCHOLARSHIP
The past scholars were so successful in gaining knowledge and acting upon it, had blessed lives, and were protected from intellectual deviations, and all this was the result of eating halaal food, and refraining from doubtful food.

RECOGNIZING GOD AND MORAL VICES
All moral vices rise from the weakness in recognizing God! If man understands that God Almighty is always and in all cases more beautiful than any beauty, he will not disjoin from intimacy with God.

TRUST IN GOD
If we trust our master only as much as a little child trusts his parents, our affairs will be solved.

CORRUPTION AND CAUSES
All corruption and aggression on earth, in the past, present, and future, is because of this eating and drinking, for obligations are aimed towards anger and carnal desires, whilst food and drink are its cause.

BELIEF IN PARADISE
If we really believed in paradise and eternal prosperity, we would not oppose the divine laws this much!

SINS AND DIVINE SIGNS
If we do not stop ourselves from committing sins, we will end up denying, belying and mocking the Divine Signs, or we may reach a point where we will become hopeless of God’s mercy.

KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION
Most of our misery is because our knowledge is not in harmony with our acts!

PERFECTION AND PRAISE
If man attains perfection, he would hear and witness the entities praising God when awake.

PROPHETIC PRACTICES
In fact, Prophet Mohammad, peace be upon his and his progeny, used to receive Divine Knowledge through his night vigils, wakefulness at dawn, and intimacy with the night… Yes, those special moments and that Divine Mercy at dawn!

CONSTANT ZIKR
Man should constantly be engaged in Zikr (invocation)! One, who is always engaged in Zikr, always sees himself in the presence of God, and is in continuous discourse with God.

HUMILITY AND GOOD ACTS
How great it is for one to say that he hasn’t anything when he carries out a good act, or an act of worship, but when he sees others doing good, he says what a great act they have!

SELF-REFORM
We must know that our remedy lies in self-reform in all stages, and we shall never become needless of it, and without it, we will never reach our goal.

SPIRITUAL VALUE OF SALAWAT
God knows best the reality, spirituality, and form of one Salawat that one recites and bestows upon a dead person.

TEARS AND DIVINE PLEASURE
These (shedding of) tears was the way of all the Prophets, peace be upon them, for the delight of meeting God, and acquiring divine pleasure. These tears of the eyes are connected to the highest of Heavens.

DESIRES AND WORSHIP
Those who have important desires, should offer the ordinary prayers and acts of worship that have been mentioned for the fulfilment of desires, and if they want to emphasize on their need and make sure that it is fulfilled, then they should go into Sajdah after their supplications and prayers and try to shed even just one tear the size of a mosquito’s wing; this is a sign of the fulfillment of the desire.

SOUL AND ASPIRATION
Although mans soul has a clothing of soil, it is capable of soaring extraordinarily high.

FRIENDSHIP AND REMEMBRANCE OF GOD
Befriend one whom, the moment you see him, you remember God and his obedience; and do not befriend those who always think about committing sins and prevent us from remembrance of God.

OBEDIENCE AS A TOOL
Is it possible for our caravan to reach the destination through this dangerous path safely, without having with us the weapon of obedience of God Almighty?

PRAYERS AND SINS
The condition for the fulfillment of prayers is abstinence from sins… sometimes the best interest is in delaying the response, and sometimes it is in altering the response for the better. The one who prays, thinks that his prayers have not been responded, whilst the people of certainty understand.

PRACTICAL ZIKR
No Zikr (invocation) is greater than practical Zikr. No practical Zikr is greater than refraining from sins in acts and beliefs.

REMEMBRANCE OF GOD AND PROXIMITY
The goal should be to spend our entire life in the remembrance of God, His obedience and in His worship, in order to reach the highest degree of proximity possible for us.

KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION
I have said repeatedly and I say again, that one who knows that, 'whoever remembers God, God will be his companion,' needs no admonishment.

ACTING ON KNOWLEDGE
Act upon what you know, and take precaution in what you do not know so that it becomes obvious for you, and if it does not become obvious, know that you have not acted upon some of your knowledge.

STUDYING AHADITH
We must deal with ahadith (in our everyday life) and study them, for remedy is within them.

MINOR SINS AND PERSISTENCE
Some people think that we have passed the stage of refraining from sins; they are unaware of the fact that sinning is not confined to the renowned greater sins; rather persistence of minor sins is also a greater sin.

AFFLICTIONS AND CERTAINTY
Afflictions are for us to reach certainty.

AWARENESS OF GOD
One who knows that he's being seen and heard by God, cannot sin. All our deviations are because we do not see God as a witness and an observer.

FEAR OF SEPARATION FROM GOD
Those who have been brought close (to God) fear their downfall, and not only hellfire, 'Suppose that I am able to endure Your chastisement, how will I endure separation from You?' [A phrase from Dua al-Kumayl].

PROSTRATION AND SATAN
Lengthening ones prostration annoys Satan.

SADAQAH AND AFFLICTIONS
Afflictions are repelled by Sadaqah, even though they may be strongly in place. This decrease (in wealth) is a cause for increase; it increases sustenance.

MYSTICISM AND MIRACLES
Do not be infatuated with stages of mysticism and miracles; sometimes such things will lead you to hell!

LYING, BACKBITING, AND SIN
If the door to lying and backbiting is opened, sinning and transgression will have no limits.

MURAQABAH AND COGNIZANCE
On the path of acquiring cognizance, one must practice muraqabah (attentive observation), and there is no benefit until he does not reach the state of Muraqabah!

RELIANCE ON CERTAINTY
May God grant us Divine Assistance so that we do not leave that which is certain, and only abide by that which is certain in all circumstances, whilst travelling, and when at home, for this will never bring regret.

OBLIGATION OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE
A small portion of acquiring religious knowledge, is obligatory upon all, such that if one finds the need, he could refer to the books of Islamic Laws, and understand the solution to his problem.

ACTION AND KNOWLEDGE
If knowledge is accompanied with action, there will not be a lack… Just the fact that one has acted in accordance with his knowledge means that he is not in a state of waiting anymore; everything else is upon God.

THANKFULNESS AND ABUNDANCE
If one looks at those who are lower, than he is and thanks God, this thankfulness itself will bring him abundance. This thankfulness itself holds weight, and causes the poor to become rich.

REFORMATION OF SOCIETY
It can be said that the reform of society, is dependent upon the reformation of the teachers and preachers.

RELIANCE ON GOD AND SUSTENANCE
Some regard reliance (on God) as sustenance for themselves, and in fact, such individuals are rich. They have come to understand that if they rely on God, their sustenance will reach them, and if it doesn’t reach, they realize that it was not necessary.

RELIANCE AND FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT
Abundance of wealth and being financially settled, is a prerequisite and it allows man to live at ease. However, one who relies upon God, lives at ease without the prerequisite.

SELF-REFORM AND RELATIONSHIPS
If you reform yourself and get rid of the obstacles, between you and God, the prophets and His close servants, then God will reform (the relationships) between you and the people.

SELF-REFORM AND DIFFICULTIES
We must know that our cure in all stages is self-reform, such that we will never be needless of it, and without it, the difficulties of our affairs will never be solved.

PRAYING FOR BELIEVERS
If one really prays for the believers, and does not pray for himself, angels will pray for him.

DIVINE RIGHTS AND WEALTH
Paying the Divine Rights, (such as Khums, Zakah and Sadaqah) causes the wealth to grow and be purified. If one does so, his money will increase.

ACQUIRING RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE
Every individual should spend a part of his day in acquiring religious knowledge, even if it is just for an hour, for instance.

WATCHFULNESS OF DEEDS
Man should be watchful of his deeds, so that he sees their good and bad results.

SELF-REFORM AND PRIORITIES
With respect to all our vices and reforming them, we do not have the time to attend to our own daily vices, let alone others’.
We must be thinking about ourselves, and reform ourselves. If we fail to reform ourselves, we would not be able to reform others.

SERVITUDE OF GOD
We must know that there is only one issue, and that is the servitude of God; the servitude of God lies in obedience to Him, and obedience to Him is in the abandonment of sins in beliefs and practice.

HEEDLESSNESS AND SATANS
The world of heedlessness is the world of preparing oneself for the satans of the man and jinn.

PRAYER FOR PROTECTION
We must ask God to protect us, every moment from all spiritual, inward, outward, worldly and afterlife harms and afflictions.

ZIKR AS PERFECTION
Zikr is the greatest perfection for man.

AFFLICTIONS AND GOD'S LOVE
Every person has a bowl full of afflictions, which is in accordance to his own existence and capacity. Everyone’s bowl is filled with afflictions, but God loves everyone.

PROSPERITY IN THE WORLD
The Prophets and the Imams have not come to ask people not to benefit from the world at all; rather they have come to show us the manner of acquiring this world along with prosperity and honor.

JOB STABILITY
May it be such that we can recognize, a job beneficial for ourselves and find stability in it, and remain steadfast in it, and not have a new thought and idea every day.

LESSONS FROM PAST GENERATIONS
We must take lessons from the past generations in that we too, like them, are close to death; and we should not be under the false impression that the four days of our remaining life would be four hundred thousand years!

MAN’S CAPACITY FOR SPIRITUAL RANK
God has created Man in such a way, that he can step higher than the rank of angels through sincere servitude, and acquire the ranks of the prophets and close servants of God.

IMPORTANCE OF QUR’AN AND SUNNAH
Any path that a man takes, without adhering to the Qur’an and Sunnah, will lead him to a continuous decline.

DAILY SELF-ASSESSMENT
Man must determine his position every day, as to whether he is from amongst the people of the truth or from amongst the people of falsehood and its follower.

LOVE AS BASIS OF SERVITUDE
The basis of servitude is love; God Almighty says, 'God loves them and they love God.' [Surah al-Ma’idah (5): 54]

MAN’S RANK
Man is worse than satan, in his descent and better than angels in his ascent.

SPIRITUALITY VS. MIRACLES
Those who, had a little spirituality did not go after miracles.

PATIENCE AND HUMILITY
We must strive to acquire patience, forbearance, and humility, and refrain from having others respect us out of fear.

MEETING GOD
If meeting God is possible in the Hereafter, then so it is even in this world, with the same criterion of possibility; however not with the physical eyes, rather with the eyes of the heart and insight.

CAUSES OF HEEDLESSNESS
We ourselves prepare the causes of danger, heedlessness, and forgetfulness of the remembrance of God almighty. The defects of our acts become apparent as a result of muraqabah (attentive observation) and muhasabah (reckoning).

SERVITUDE AND PROXIMITY
Man can traverse the straight path of servitude, in all circumstances and afflictions, and consequently, acquire proximity.

MERCY AND PUNISHMENT
If we do not become bad, that which descends upon us from above will not become bad; rather we do things that change the rains of mercy into punishment.

LOYALTY TO SCHOLARS
We must be loyal to the Shia scholars. They are our benevolent and spiritual kind fathers and they have many rights upon us.

VANITY OF THE WORLD
If only we understood the vanity of this contingent world and that we would not give so much value and importance to ‘nothing’, and that we would not have so many disputes with each other over ‘nothing’!

PEACE THROUGH REMEMBRANCE
Man cannot achieve peace through anything other than trust in God and His remembrance; and nothing makes life bitter and horrible the way heedlessness and turning away from His remembrance does.

DOUBTFUL FOOD AND WORSHIP
Eating doubtful food, as well as eating the food of one, who does not abstain from Haram, although permissible, makes a man ill and prevents him from worship, or becomes the cause of the loss of tawfeeq (Divine Assistance).

PATH OF GOD AND SERVITUDE
Have we found the path of God and servitude so that we stay on the path?!

RECOGNITION OF RESPONSIBILITIES
Recognition of responsibilities is a light in the heart of a believer. If he acts upon his obligations, imprisonment and torture would be easy for him.

SELF-REFORM AND ENEMIES
Man does with himself that which no enemy does with him; he dries the source of self-reform until the Day of Judgment!

FAITH IN DIFFICULTIES
God strengthens the faith of those who remain steadfast in times of difficulties, so they are not defeated by any affliction, and they leave this world with faith, remembrance, and the love of God.

MINORITY AND MAJORITY
The minority of the people of truth, and the majority of the people of falsehood, must not worry, discourage, or prevent us from traversing the path of truth.

PRIDE AND DANGER
We must not become proud! Until the time of death, and as long as satan is alive, man is in danger. We seek refuge in God.

SELF-RELIANCE AND SATAN
If man is left to himself for the blink of an eye, he would be separated from God, and satan will do his job and deceive him.

PERCEPTION OF DEATH
Bidding farewell to this world is very close for us; however, we see it as very far, else we would not have so many conflicts with each other.

PERFECTION AND SERVITUDE
The door to reaching perfection and meeting God is open. Is it not a pity to not have and be deprived of these stages, which are gained through the servitude of God?

ZUHD AND ATTACHMENT
Practicing zuhd is not in conflict with having the world; the criterion in Zuhd is not having or not having the world; rather, it is attaching or not attaching oneself to the world.

HONESTY AND SPIRITUALITY
Honesty is very effective in seeing true dreams and in spiritual purity.

RELIGIOUS RELATIONSHIP AND HELP
Is it possible, for one to have religious and spiritual relationship with God and His close servants, and not be helped in critical times, rather, left disheartened and without guidance?

SEEKING INTERCESSION IN DIFFICULTIES
In times of difficulties and afflictions, man has no option but to seek the intercession of God, and take refuge in Him every moment.

ATTACHMENT TO THE WORLD
Look at what the worshippers of this world have attached themselves to and fight over; a world of paper, carton, and cobwebs!

DIVINE INSPIRATION
Elham (Divine Inspiration) is a great stage at the level of revelation; we are not seekers (of divine blessings), else divine blessings are never cut off.

STRENGTH AND FAITH
It is very good if God grants man such a strength and will that he does not grieve for other than God. This requires courage, faith, and steadfastness.

SUPPLICATION DURING OCCULTATION
This is a great supplication and we have been ordered to recite it during the period of occultation: 'Yā Allah, Yā Rahmān, Yā Rahīm, Yā Muqallib al-Qulūb, Thabbit Qalbī ‘alā dīnik.' (O God, O Beneficent, O Merciful, O turner of Hearts, make my heart steadfast in your religion!)

LACK OF DIVINE BLESSINGS
Not carrying out good acts such as giving alms, and building charity organizations, mosques, Hussainiyas, baths, schools and hospitals and …, which people are deprived of nowadays, is not due to lack of money; rather, it is out of the lack of divine blessings.

AFFLICTIONS AS MERCY
The afflictions that befall us are all mercy; in the least, they are the causes of the atonement of our sins.

GRATITUDE AND OBEDIENCE
Gratitude for bounties means obedience to God, which leads to an increase in bounties. Ingratitude means disobedience to God and this leads to divine punishment.

ATTENTION TO GOD
If one cuts off his attention and relation with all other than God, his relation with God would be definite.

HUMILITY IN EASE
During the times of ease, we must have the state of humility, lamentation, tawassul (seeking intercession), and be thankful, so that they help us during times of intensity and affliction, else we will encounter those plights and afflictions.

GRATITUDE AND INCREASE IN BOUNTIES
Gratitude causes an increase in bounties, and if you do not thank (God), there will be no increase (in bounties). Therefore, if we do not see any increase (in bounties), we should know that it is because of the lack of thankfulness.

ENTREATY AND TRIBULATIONS
God Himself sends tribulations, '(Why did they not entreat) when Our punishment overtook them' [Surah al-An’aam (6): 43] out of entreaty, i.e., He wants His servant to entreat and lament to Him, and this is desired.

SURRENDER AND RESPONSIBILITIES
If you want to reach somewhere [higher stations] through supplications, then you must be saying this: 'We surrender to God, let Him do whatever He intends to, we intend to act according to the responsibilities of servitude.'

MURAQABAH AND KNOWLEDGE
God knows best the effects that Muraqabah (attentive observation) and attention have on man’s soul and in the acquisition of knowledge and ma'rifah (Divine Knowledge).

DISTANCE TO GOAL
All of us have a distance to the ultimate goal and destination. We must try not to make the distance longer or our load heavier. Sins make the load heavier and our distance to the destination longer!

SELF-CONTROL AND PRESENCE OF GOD
There is no doubt in the fact that if one pays attention to this one point it would suffice for him and it entails all the meanings and results of exercising strict self-control. The point is that man sees himself in the presence of God and acknowledges that God is aware of him, present everywhere, and observer of all of his states and deeds.

THANKLESSNESS AND AFFLICTIONS
All these plights and afflictions are the result of thanklessness and ingratitude for our bounties.

HARAM AND BELIEF
Woe upon us, if we do not avoid eating and drinking haram, for it is our food that becomes the cause of our knowledge and faith, or disbelief.

FOOD AND BELIEF
God knows best how much involvement food has on one’s belief and disbelief, and good and bad deeds.

PATH OF SALVATION
The path of salvation is to escape and return to God and His Awliya.

CHOICE BETWEEN COMPANIONSHIP
Man, through his own will, can become either the companion of Salman or that of Abu Jahl.

PEACE THROUGH REMEMBRANCE
If man’s heart acquires peace, with the remembrance of God, it will be addressed thus: 'O Peaceful Soul!' [Surah al-Fajr (89): 27]

LIMITATIONS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT REVELATION
Without revelation and the teachings of the prophets, peace be upon them, man’s knowledge has greater harm than benefits.

URGENCY IN ACTION
It is good for man to not postpone today’s work for tomorrow, rather, to not delay the work of a certain time to another hour, unless with an excuse, for he does not know what would happen after that time.

GUIDANCE FROM SHARI'AH IN AFFLICTIONS
When encountered by afflictions, we must look into the book of Shari'ah at each and every step. Wherever there is clarity, we should step forward and act upon it, and in places of doubt, we must halt.

SPIRITUALITY AND MATERIAL DESIRES
Woe upon us if we use spirituality as a means to reach our material and transient desires!

RESTRICTED TO CERTAINTY IN FAITH
How bound must the pious be in order to refrain from acting upon that which is uncertain! Protecting one’s faith is like walking on fire or holding fire in one’s hands.

CREATING A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT AT HOME
If we want the environment in the house to be warm, pure, and friendly, we have to be patient, steadfast, forbearing, forgiving, and benevolent, so that warmth and blessings prevail in the house.

SELF-REFLECTION AND IGNORING OTHERS’ FAULTS
Fortunate is he who sees his own faults, and pays attention to his own vices, ignores other’s faults, and does not see himself as perfect and without defects.

REPENTANCE AND AVOIDANCE OF JUSTIFYING WRONGDOINGS
We must close the door of justifying our wrongdoings and repent for every sin, and compensate for it wherever possible.

ATTRACTION TO HARAM
May it not happen that Haram becomes attractive to man! This is a disease of the soul that man is afflicted with such that he is caught up in haraam despite there being numerous halaal ways for fulfilling his needs.

KNOWLEDGE AND RELIGIOUS PRACTICE OF SALMAN
Salman, peace be upon him, knew the first and the last knowledge as a result of learning the obligations, abiding by them, and obeying the religion with the light of intellect.

RELIGIOSITY IN CHOICES
The religiosity of a person comes to be known when he finds himself choosing between the world or the hereafter, and obeying satan and the self or serving God.

GRIEF, SORROW, AND ACCEPTANCE OF PRAYERS
Grief, sorrow, and crying are acts of the heart, so much so that crying and tears are signs of the acceptance of the Witr prayers. [The last Rak'ah of Night prayers]

FOCUS ON ACTS THAT IMPROVE STATE
We must resort to every such act that improves our state and increases our attention towards God, and we must busy ourselves with those acts, the remembrance of God, self-watchfulness, and paying attention to God.

VIRTUE OF SCHOLARS AND THEIR PRACTICE
Those whom, like the prophets, have been appointed to preaching, and carry out their work without any favors and obligations, God knows best what ranks they hold! Of course, this is only if the scholar is aware of the do's and don’ts and himself practices that which he encourages and forbids.

VIRTUE OF CRYING FOR IMAM HUSSAIN
In my [humble] opinion, crying for the sake of Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, is higher in virtue than the night prayers.

CONSTANT CONNECTION WITH GOD
God wants us to be with Him, at all times and remain connected to the spring; and this is to our benefit.
 
RESPONSIBILITY AND RESULTS
Our responsibility is only to carry out Amr, bil-Ma’roof [i.e. enjoin the good] and Nahi anil Munkar [forbid the evil] where possible; but its results are not in our hands.

AFFLICTIONS AND BLESSINGS
What do we know! God knows that some afflictions are the prerequisite of some blessings. Someone would say, 'I got afflicted with such and such a difficulty and it increased my knowledge.'

IDENTIFYING DIVINE OBLIGATIONS
If only we understood that, our remedy lies in one thing only, and that is to identify the divine obligations and know which acts to carry out, and which ones to refrain from.

OBSTACLES TO ACCEPTANCE OF DEEDS
Pride, arrogance, and jealousy, are obstacles to acceptance of our deeds, because God almighty says, 'Indeed God accepts only from the pious.' [Surah al-Ma’dah 5: 27]

DEALING WITH INSULTS
Unworthy abuses and insults, should not upset, discourage, and leave us lazy from the path and goal.

SUPPLICATIONS FROM THE INFALLIBLES
Our Infallibles, peace be upon them, have left supplications at our disposal in order to see us dwelling in light.

DISTANCE FROM THE WORLD
The prophets, peace be upon them, have come in order to distance us as well as our attention from the world.

LOFTINESS OF OBEDIENCE
If one observes his duties, he is loftier than angels, and no longer must he be worried.

HUMILITY IN WORSHIP
That was Satan's end after six thousand years of worship; can we then be proud of ourselves?! We seek refuge in God!

SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING
If you get the chance to, teach, study or write, you must seize the opportunity.

INTELLECT AND RELIGION
You can prove the principles of religion, with the light of intellect. Those who are against (intellectual) principles and intellectual reasoning are promoting anti-religionism, because 'There is no religion for the one who has no intellect.'

EFFECT OF FOOD ON FAITH
Woe to us if we don’t avoid Haram, in eating and drinking! Since it is these foods that are the cause of getting us to knowledge and faith or infidelity. God knows how much effect eating has on our belief and disbelief, our good deeds and bad deeds.

PERFECTION IN PIETY
The perfection of man lies in, piety, not a word less or more than that.

PERCEPTION IN AFFLICTIONS
May God grant us the Tawfeeq, (Divine Assistance) that if we are caught in the midst of afflictions and tests, we do not see the bad as good and the good as bad. We are spoiled; may it be such that we realize that we are spoiled, so that we begin thinking about reforming and curing ourselves.

LEARNING FROM SCHOLARS
Referring to the biographies, of the scholars of the past is like referring to authentic books on ethics.

SHORT ACTS OF WORSHIP
God knows best, the effect that these short and brief acts of worship have, if carried out by those worthy of it.

PEACEFULNESS OF THE HEART
Having means of ease and luxury, is other than having peacefulness of the heart, 'Indeed hearts find rest in God's remembrance!’ [Surah ar-Ra‘d 13: 28] This means that the only means of peacefulness of the heart is Zikrollah (Remembrance of God); but we rely on other causes and are neglectful of the Cause of all causes.

FUTURE OF CHILDREN AND PRAYER
Some scholars would secure the future, of their children by recommending the offering of prayers at their time and night prayers.

IMPACT OF PRAYING FOR OTHERS
If we remain indifferent, and do not pray for the relief of believers from the troubles and afflictions encountered by them, those afflictions will get closer to us also.

TRUE EASE AND LUXURY
The goodness of pleasure, is not only due to the excess of ease; inward ease, welfare, and peacefulness of the heart are not acquired by having ease and luxury; rather ease and luxury too may bring about anxiety and distress!

MATERIALS AS A MEANS
May it be such that, worldly materials be only a means for us, in a way that if the world welcomes us, it causes us to pay more attention to spirituality and the Hereafter.

TAKING PRECAUTIONS
There is no act in, which taking precaution would bring about regret.

PATIENCE IN POVERTY
The poor should have patience, in poverty and destitution, and they should know that they have other bounties that the rich do not have, and that the rich have difficulties and afflictions that the poor and the destitute do not have.

REACHING PROPHETIC STATIONS
Man is capable of acquiring all the stations, of the Prophets, peace be upon them, except the specific stations of the special Prophets.

IMPERFECTION DUE TO SELF-OBEDIENCE
Man’s imperfection is due to his obeying the self, and his distance from the teachings and obedience of the Prophets, peace be upon them.

CONTENTMENT AND NEEDS
It is impossible for one who does not take to contentment, to be satisfied with that which he has! On the other hand, if one is content, his needs shall be fulfilled, even if they are a lot!

PRAYING FOR BELIEVERS
Is it possible that we feel the need, for praying for the difficulties of the believers in the same manner, or even more than we feel the need for bread and water at the time of hunger and thirst?

CONCERN FOR MUSLIM AFFAIRS
Can we be felicitous while being indifferent to the affairs of Muslims and believers?! Is it possible to reach the goal without tending to the affairs of Muslims?

HEEDLESSNESS OF DEATH
Every night, we journey through purgatory without having any authority, yet we are heedless of death! How close man is to death, yet how far does he see it from himself and is heedless of it!

PARTICIPATION IN NOBLE ACTS
It is good that man, has his name written in every noble act and take part in it, for he does not know which one will be accepted and which one rejected on the Day of Judgment.

INITIATIVES FOR GOOD ACTS
Man must think about ways of carrying out good acts, and this should bring about initiatives helpful for reaching the goal.

DYING IN A GOOD STATE
Felicitous are those who, die in a good state, and are welcomed nicely in the hereafter!

INTEGRATION WITH DISBELIEVERS
Resemblance and integration with disbelievers makes their dominance and authority over Muslims easier.

LOVE FOR THE QUR’AN AND AHL AL-BAYT
May there arise within us, love for the entire Qur’an, and Ahl al-Bayt, so that primarily, we are able to find the oneness of the Qur'an and Ahl al-Bayt and the confected composite of the two; and secondly, at the level of following and acting upon them, we perform a loving circumambulation on their basis and whilst paying attention to them, and that we come to realize that they are the worthiest of being loved compared to every other beloved.

SPIRITUAL STATIONS AND DIVINE LIGHTS
God knows best the state, of those who have spiritual stations at the time of supplication and solitude; and how the silence of pondering burns them as a result of witnessing the divine lights, even if for a short duration.

OBEDIENCE TO GOD VS. SIN
In obeying the commands of God, and in committing sins and obeying the commands of Satan and the self, is it better to be in the company of he in whose hands is our life and death, wealth and poverty, sickness and wellbeing, doctor, treasures, wealth, etc. […] or he who has nothing?!

EASE OF OBEDIENCE
For the ease of obedience, and avoidance of sins, we have no other way than to know and be certain of the fact that obedience is the nearness to all bounties, pleasures, wealth, and honor whilst sinfulness is privation, displeasure, destitution and dishonor […]. 

GRIEF, SUPPLICATION, AND DIVINE DECREE
Grief, supplication, and tawassul (seeking intercession) have no contradiction with surrendering and submission to the Divine Decree.

MA’RIFAH (DIVINE COGNIZANCE) AS A TEACHER
If one deserves it, meaning that he is eager to seek Ma'rifah (Divine Cognizance), and if he has endeavor and a sincerity of intention, with the permission of God, all of creation would become his teacher.

INWARD WARMTH AND INTIMACY WITH RELIGION
May we have an inward warmth, and intimacy with the Holy Qur'an, religion, and the necessities and preliminaries of religiosity, and may the Qur'an and Ahl al-Bayt be sufficient for us so that we become certain of the rightfulness of religion.

ACTING UPON CERTAINTIES AND PRECAUTION
Our Imams, peace be upon them, have taught us to act upon certainties and to halt and take precaution in whatever we are not sure about.

LOVE OF VISITING PARADISE
Some of those who were brought close to God, have died out of the love of visiting paradise, because listening to the verses of blessing and bounties or punishment and vengeance surely leaves an ontological effect in a Monotheist.

HUMILITY IN SUJDAH (PROSTRATION)
Sajdah is the epitome of humility, – [it implies] that we are nothing before you.

ZIKR IN PRAYERS AS THE BEST FORM OF REMEMBRANCE
Zikr (invocation of God), in prayers is the best Zikr, since prayers are at the position of the Ka'ba; one who prays has entered the divine sanctuary of God and has intended to enter from the gate of Takbeer (Allahu Akbar) and exit from the gate of Tasleem (the last Salam of prayers).

DIFFERENCES IN SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE OF PRAYERS
These apparent and easy deeds, such as prayers help some ascend to the Heavens; and for some it is nothing! For some, it is the A'la Elliyeen (the highest of the Heavens), whilst others cannot understand if this confection is salty or sweet!

IMPORTANCE OF CONTROLLED SENSORY INPUT FOR SPIRITUALITY
One of the factors for acquiring the presence of heart, during prayers is to keep all our senses under control during the twenty-four hours, in order to provide the basis for the acquisition of the presence of heart. Throughout the day, we must keep our eyes, ears, and all our other parts under control.

SWEETNESS OF PRAYERS DESPITE FEAR
The same prayers that we perform, with the threat of being caned and whipped, and with the fear of being punished in hell (as a result of missing them), some say, 'It is sweeter than everything.'

RELIGIOSITY AND CHOICE BETWEEN WORLDLY AND OTHERWORLDLY
Our religiosity will be known when we get to a junction where we have to either choose this world or the Hereafter; to obey the self and Satan or servitude of God.

PRELIMINARIES FOR FEELING PLEASURE IN PRAYERS
There are a series of preliminaries, both inside and outside prayers, which would help one feel the pleasure in prayers. That which needs to be paid attention before and outside prayers is that one must refrain from committing sins, and not blacken his heart. Sins sadden the soul and take away the light from the heart. As for during the prayers, one must set up chains around himself so that no one besides God enters the heart; in other words, he must not think about anyone other than God.

TRUE PRAYERS AND MORAL CONDUCT
From the verse, ‘Indeed the prayer restrains from indecent and wrongful conduct,’ it is learnt that ‘one who does not refrain from unworthy acts, his prayers are not the true prayers.’

NIGHT PRAYERS AND SECRET SPIRITUAL ADVANCE
It is as though, those who perform night prayers have overtaken secretly.

REFORMING PRAYERS THROUGH APPARENT AND INNER REALITY
Reforming the prayers, means reforming its apparent as well as its inner reality, and refraining from apparent and hidden evils. Amongst the ways of reforming prayers is seeking the intercession of the Imam seriously, just before starting the prayers.

SIGNIFICANCE OF STANDING AND SUJUD (PROSTRATION) IN PRAYERS
The standing of a servant, during prayers is the sign of servitude and tranquility, and that he has no movement from his own self, and Sajdah is the epitome of humility.

PURPOSE OF REPEATING PRAYERS
Perhaps the wisdom, behind repeating prayers, other than consolidation, is wayfaring such that every prayer is better than the previous one and the previous prayer paves the way for the next prayer.

PRAYERS AS A MANIFESTATION OF SERVITUDE
Prayers is the greatest manifestation, of servitude in which there's great attention to God.

PRAYERS AS A TIME FOR DIVINE PRESENCE
Prayers is, the best time for meeting and being in the presence of God. Prayers have been established for submission and humility with all its stages.

THE ROLE OF THE INTERMEDIARY IN PRAYERS
Despite the fact, that we do not receive revelations and inspiration, we do not pay attention to that intermediary who does receive revelations and inspirations; and this is despite the fact that we can resort to him for all our difficulties, regardless of whether spiritual or physical, worldly, or of the hereafter.

INTERCESSION OF IMAM MAHDI
Imam Mahdi, may God hasten his reappearance, has the highest degree of knowledge, and the greatest Divine Name (Ism al-Azam) is with him more than everyone else; yet, he has asked everyone that has been blessed with his visitation, whilst awake or in a dream, “Pray for me!”

PRAYING FOR IMAM MAHDI’S REAPPEARANCE
The sole way, of getting rid of difficulties is to pray for the reappearance of Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him, in solitude, not the usual prayers and the movement of the tongue; rather prayers with sincerity and purity of intention, accompanied with repentance.

DISCUSSING THE REAPPEARANCE OF IMAM MAHDI
I wish we would sit and talk about the time, of the reappearance of Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him, so that we would at least be regarded as those awaiting his reappearance.

RECOGNIZING TRUE REFUGE IN BELIEF
If the believers recognize, their true place of refuge and seek refuge in it, is it still possible that they will not be blessed by it?

ALIGNMENT WITH THE IMAM’S EMOTIONS
Is it possible for our Master, Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him, to be grieved, and for us to be happy; for him to weep because of the afflictions of his friends, and for us to laugh and be cheerful; and despite all of this, consider ourselves his followers?

THE SUN AND IMAM MAHDI IN OCCULTATION
The sun is meant to shine, even though it may be behind the clouds. Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him is the same, even though he may be in occultation! We do not see him but there were, and still are people that see him, and if they do not see him, they have some form of contact with him.

ASKING FOR THE IMAM’S RELIEF AT SACRED PLACES
Whoever goes to a sacred place, such as Masjid Jamkaran, for a need, must first ask God for the Imam’s relief, which is the greatest desire of the Imam himself.

DEEDS PRESENTED TO IMAM MAHDI
In the records of Imam Mahdi, who is presented with the deeds of the people twice a week (on Mondays and Thursdays), God knows best which group we belong to. All we do know is that we are not that which we should be.

SIN AND IMAM MAHDI’S DISTRESS
It is because of our sins, and deeds that the Imam is fearful and wandering in deserts for a thousand years.

SUPPLICATION FOR RELIEF DURING OCCULTATION
It is narrated, that during the period of occultation everyone shall perish except those that pray for the relief. It is as though this very supplication for the relief is a source of hope and spiritual relationship with him who is prayed for. This in itself is a level of relief.

IMAM MAHDI’S PRESENCE IN THE HEART OF EVERY SHI’A
How much should we say that Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him, has a Mosque in the heart of every Shi’a.

CONCERN FOR THE IMAM
All of us are concerned, about their own personal desires, and we are not concerned about the Imam, whilst being concerned for him is beneficial for all, and is of the greatest of necessities.

SELF-REFORM AND IMAM’S REAPPEARANCE
The Holy Infallibles, peace be upon them, have said, 'Reform yourselves, and we ourselves will come to you; you do not need to be looking for us.'

SWEETNESS OF THE REAPPEARANCE OF IMAM MAHDI
May God sweeten, the mouth of all the Shiites with the reappearance of the hidden Imam, peace be upon him! Sweets are foods that are beyond our necessities, but the sweetness of the reappearance of Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him, is of the greatest of necessities.

GRIEF AND HUMILITY IN PRAYER FOR IMAM MAHDI’S REAPPEARANCE
Should we not ponder, and pray with grief and humility for the arrival of the true reformer, and relief for the Muslims, i.e. Imam Mahdi, may God hasten his reappearance?

PRAYING FOR FAITH AND STEADFASTNESS
More important, than praying for the hastening of the reappearance of Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him, is to pray for our faith, steadfastness in our beliefs, not denying the Imam until his reappearance.

VISITING MASJID JAMKARAN WITH THE RIGHT INTENTION
It is a pity, that everyone goes to Masjid Jamkaran for the fulfillment of his or her personal desires, whilst he or she do not know how the Imam himself requests them to pray for the hastening of his reappearance.

AWARENESS OF ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IMAM’S WAYS
Even though Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him, is hidden from us, and we are deprived of the blessings of his presence, we are aware of the acts that are or are not in accordance with his school and ways. We also know whether we please him with our acts and conduct and, although meagre, send salutations to him, or displease him with our unworthy acts.

SIGNS OF THE IMAM’S REAPPEARANCE
They have mentioned, certain and uncertain signs of the reappearance of the Imam, peace be upon him; but it is not unlikely for them to inform us that he shall re-appear tomorrow. The consequence of this is that alteration of the Divine Will would take place in some of the signs, whilst some of the imminent signs would occur right at the time of reappearance.

IMAM MAHDI’S COMPASSION
How benevolent is the Imam, to those who utter his name, call upon him, and seek his help; he is more compassionate to them than their own parents are.

MEETING THE INFALLIBLES THROUGH VISITS TO SHRINES
If one seeks to quench, his thirst of meeting the Infallibles, peace be upon them, then visiting the shrines of Ahl al-Bayt is like meeting them, and Imam Mahdi. They are present and watching [us] everywhere.

THE CONTINUITY OF LIFE AND DEATH OF THE IMAMS
The most important ethic, of Ziarah is for us to know that there is no difference between the life of the Imams and their death.

EXTENSIVE MERCY OF AHL AL-BAYT
God knows [best], how extensive the mercy of Ahl al-Bayt and the progeny of the Prophet is! Their Mercy is in line with the Extensive Mercy of God.

VIRTUES OF THE IMAMZADAHS’ GRAVES
One of the virtues of Shia, is the graves of the Imamzadahs (the descendants of the Imams); therefore, we must not be heedless of them and end up intentionally depriving ourselves.

NIGHTS OF EID AL-GHADEER AND SIMILAR OCCASIONS
On the night of Eid al-Ghadeer, and other similar nights, rather than spending sessions in laughter, play, and diversion, the virtues of these days and nights and the vices of their enemies, as well as the narrations regarding Wilayah should be mentioned with logical reasoning so that it would strengthen the religious beliefs of the listeners.

LOVE FOR AHL AL-BAYT
One must not let go of his love for Ahl al-Bayt, Everything is in their love; if we have anything, it is because of their love.

BENEFITS OF TAWASSUL AND VISITING IMAMZADAHS
Tawassul [seeking an intermediary], is very beneficial. Visit these Imamzadahs! Just like fruits, each of which has an important vitamin, these great men too have specific characteristics and effects.

VISITING SHRINES
If one visits one of the shrines, of Ahl al-Bayt, it is as though he has visited all the shrines in all the places and this is beneficial for him.

LEARNING FROM THE INFALLIBLES
Why do us Shias, not sit at the foot of the pulpit of the Commander of the Faithful, the Imams of Guidance, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon them, every day, and listen to their words of wisdom, ethics, and the unlimited knowledge that is hidden in their words.

LOVE AND DEVOTION TOWARDS AHL AL-BAYT
May this love and devotion towards Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, remain in our hearts, and may we leave this world with their love still in our hearts.

VALUING THE SHRINE OF IMAM REZA
Iranians must value, the blessing of the Holy Shrine of Imam Reza, whose ziarah is possible for them.

FOLLOWING THE INFALLIBLES AND STAYING INFORMED
Follow in the footsteps, of the Infallibles, not in the footsteps of others! Stay with Ulema (Islamic Scholars), always be well informed, and be concerned with useful, life-inspiring information.

ZIARAT AND WEALTH
The blessing, of performing ziarat has nothing to do with having money.

SEEING AHL AL-BAYT EVERYWHERE
Salvation is, for one who sees Ahl al-Bayt present and the addressee everywhere.

AFFLICTIONS AND DISTANCE FROM AHL AL-BAYT
Every affliction, that we encounter is the result of our distance from Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, and their authentic narrations.

IMAMS' AWARENESS OF OUR STATES
The Imams, peace be upon them, are never heedless of our states, even though we may be heedless of them.

RECOGNITION OF THE IMAM AND GOD
If the recognition, of the Imam increases, recognition of God will also increase, for is there any sign greater than the Imam? Imam is the mirror that reflects the realities of the entire universe.

MOTIVATION FOR WORSHIP
The Holy Infallibles, both feared hell, and desired heaven, but they did not worship out of their fear and desires.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE HEREAFTER
The relationship of this world, with the hereafter is like that of a mother's womb with this world; death is the birth of the soul.

RECORDING OF OUR WORDS AND INTENTIONS
Angels record our voices, and they record both our words, as well as if they have been uttered with a divine motive, or with a carnal and satanic purpose.

PURPOSE OF CREATION AND KNOWLEDGE
The consequence of creation, and the creature in the Hadith Qudsi: '[O Muhammad] I have created all things for you and you for myself' is knowledge and [Divine] Cognizance.
