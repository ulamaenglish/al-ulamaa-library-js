THE COLONIZATION PLAN FOR STUDENTS

In our time, colonization, wherever it sets foot, focuses on the very issue that the Quran warns about; it seeks to corrupt the hearts. Once the heart is corrupted, not only does the mind lose its ability to function, but it also becomes a larger chain that restricts the person's actions. This is why we see colonizers and exploiters of humanity, while not afraid to open schools and universities—and even actively establishing them—at the same time, they do everything in their power to corrupt and ruin the hearts and souls of students. They are well aware of the truth that a sick and diseased heart can do nothing, and will submit to any form of degradation, exploitation, and oppression.

ISLAM'S PROHIBITION OF UNRELATED MEN AND WOMEN INTERACTIONS

Islam has no enmity with anyone. If it enforces a boundary between men and women, it is because men do not have the right to derive pleasure from other women in any manner. There is sexual gratification involved in these interactions. Every action in Islam is calculated and deliberate. If the only issue were that a man shakes hands with a woman, or even kisses her and dances with her, and if this was the extent of the interaction without affecting other areas, causing no further damage, and not undermining the foundation of human society, then Islam would not be envious; it would simply say, "Go ahead and do it." However, such actions destroy the foundational social unit, which is the family, the primary center for human upbringing. If we permit this, we must bid farewell to the family unit permanently. Woe to a society where people want to live in the world but not within the familial core.

TOLSTOY'S WISE WORDS ON THE ROLE OF FAITH

The famous Russian philosopher Tolstoy was once asked: "What is faith? Please define it for us." He replied, "Faith is that which a person lives by; it is the capital of life." Truly, what a simple yet profound statement. Faith is what humanity lives by. Compare this statement with the mindset of a few naive, uninformed individuals who think that religion is a burden to humanity and that atheism is a form of freedom and lightness! They think that not adhering to anything is called freedom, which leads them to believe that not adhering to reason, humanity, morality, and integrity is also freedom. However, this great Russian philosopher deeply understood the value of "spiritual capital." He does not say that faith is a burden; he says it is "capital." When I read Tolstoy's words, I was reminded of the famous poem by Nasir Khusraw, where he says to his son: "I turned from the world to religion, O Iraq, What would the world have been to me without faith, but a prison? For in religion, I have a kingdom in my heart, Which will never be destroyed."

FAITH AND ACTION TWO TWIN CONCEPTS

Islam always emphasizes that faith and action, as expressed in the Quran, are inseparable. The phrase "those who believe and do righteous deeds" is repeated numerous times throughout the Quran, indicating that faith and action are like twin companions in the Quran. With this expression, the Quran wants to convey that faith alone is not enough for salvation; action without faith also leads nowhere and has no effect. Faith means having a correct vision, a specific vision that begins with the recognition of God, while action means movement—action based on that vision. Many pieces of information in the world are simply knowledge that doesn't give a person any direction. However, some knowledge, insights, and visions automatically give a person ideas and goals. The faith that Islam talks about, as faith in God, the afterlife, and the prophethood of the Prophet, inherently gives a person goals. Religious faith is not just knowledge and belief; it also involves ideals. This faith, which is a vision paired with ideals, requires movement that aligns with that faith and those ideals. As the Quran says, "those who do righteous deeds"—righteous action, which means a movement or action in accordance with that faith and those ideals.

BEAUTIFUL SEPARATION FROM INSULTERS

Allah commands the Prophet: "Be patient with what they say." Even though they say many inappropriate things, remain patient and restrain yourself. "Separate yourself from them beautifully." What does "separating beautifully" mean? It means that while you distance yourself from them, do not react with violence. For example, when you see that they are insulting and cursing you, walk away calmly as though you did not hear anything. The commentators say that this means even though you distance yourself from them, your separation should not prevent you from giving advice, guidance, and preaching. When you see them speaking ill, step aside for a moment but in a graceful manner. There is a poem attributed to Imam Ali that aligns closely with this verse. He says: "I pass by an arrogant and vile person who is insulting me. I calmly walk by and say, 'He wasn't talking about me.'" This is the essence of "beautiful separation" – stepping away without tearing the veil of respect and not reacting violently. For example, if your child speaks disrespectfully to you, if you confront them directly, the veil between you will be torn. Instead, you pretend you didn't hear it, and step away calmly, without acknowledging it. Later, you do not bring it up. This is the meaning of "separate yourself from them beautifully" – Distance yourself from them, but do so gracefully, so you can later advise, guide, and lead them back on the right path.

EGOISTIC DESIRES PREVENT CLEAR THINKING

One significant factor that leads to mistakes, as mentioned in the Quran, is following one's desires and having personal biases. As Rumi puts it: "When desire comes, art is hidden, A hundred veils rise from the heart to the eye." In any matter, unless a person frees themselves from the influence of personal bias and desire, they cannot think clearly. That is, the intellect can only function properly when personal desires are absent. A famous story is told about Allama Hilli: He was faced with a legal issue about what should be done if an animal dies in a well. Coincidentally, an animal fell into the well at his home, and he had to make a decision. There were two ways to approach the issue: the first was to fill the well completely, and the second was to remove a certain amount of water and use the rest. Allama Hilli realized that he could not make a fair judgment without first removing his personal bias. Therefore, he ordered the well to be filled, so that he could later give a fatwa without any emotional pressure or bias.

MEMORY OF MY FATHER

What harm is there in me recalling the merits of my noble father? As far back as I can remember at least from 40 years ago, I would see this great and honorable man never allowing his sleep to be delayed past three hours after midnight. He would wake up at least two hours before dawn—and three hours on Friday nights—and the least amount of Quran he would recite was one Juz part of the Quran. With such tranquility and peace, he would perform his night prayers. Now, nearly a hundred years have passed since his time, and I never see him having a restless sleep. It is the spiritual joy that has kept him grounded. Not a night goes by without him praying for his parents. He had a stepmother whom he respected deeply. Every night, he would remember her and all his relatives—near and far. These are the kinds of things that nourish the heart. A person who seeks such deep spiritual enjoyment necessarily sacrifices material pleasures to attain this deeper, divine joy.

THE SOURCE OF IMAMS' KNOWLEDGE

As our esteemed teacher, Allama Tabatabai explains in the commentary on verse 3 of Surah Aal-Imran, the source of the Imams' knowledge is divine understanding. It was once asked from Imam Ali: "Do you receive any revelations?" He replied: "No, by the One who split the seed and created life, except that Allah grants His servant an understanding of His Book." From this statement, it becomes clear that Imam Ali derived his abundant and astonishing knowledge solely from the Quran and its infinite fountains of wisdom. It is the spiritual essence of the Quran that flows from the unseen and divine realm into the pure heart of Imam Ali.

FAITH IS NOT JUST KNOWLEDGE

The Quran presents the most striking examples of disbelievers as being among the best "knowers." It introduces beings who know God to the highest degree, who recognize the prophets and divine authorities at the highest level, and who fully comprehend the concept of the afterlife—yet they are still disbelievers. Who is such a being? Satan! Does Satan recognize God? Is he a materialist who denies God's existence? Not at all. Satan knows God far more intimately than we do. He even worshipped God for thousands of years. So why does the Quran label Satan as a disbeliever? It says: "He was one of the disbelievers." If faith were merely knowledge—as some philosophers claim—then Satan should have been the first believer. But Satan is not a believer. He is a knowing rejecter—he recognizes the truth, yet willfully opposes it. He is not submissive to the truth he knows; he has no inclination or movement toward that truth. Therefore, faith is not merely knowledge.

JESUS TEACHES HUMILITY TO SCHOLARS

Jesus once said to his disciples: "I have a request—if you promise to fulfill it, I will tell you what it is." The disciples replied: "Whatever you ask, we will obey." Jesus then stood up and began washing the feet of each of them. The disciples felt uneasy, but since they had promised to accept his request, they remained silent and allowed him to finish. After Jesus had washed all their feet, they said: "You are our teacher. It was more appropriate for us to wash your feet, not the other way around." Jesus replied: "I did this to show you that the one who is most deserving of serving people is the scholar. I performed this act to demonstrate humility so that you would learn it and make humility and service to others your way of life when you take on the responsibility of guiding and teaching people after me. Indeed, wisdom grows in the soil of humility, just as plants grow in soft, fertile ground—not in the hard soil of mountains."

IMAM ALI IN THE WORDS OF MARTYR MOTAHHARI

In truth, Ali is like the laws of nature that remain eternal. He is a never-ending source, growing day by day. As Khalil Gibran said, he is one of those rare personalities who was born before his time. Some people are leaders only in their own time, while others lead a little beyond their time, but gradually their leadership fades. However, Ali and a few others among mankind are always guides and leaders. Before being a just Imam for others, and before acting justly toward others, Ali was inherently balanced and well-proportioned. He gathered all the perfections of humanity within himself. He had deep and far-reaching thoughts, but also tender and abundant emotions. He had both physical and spiritual perfection. By night, during his worship, he detached himself from the worldly, and by day, he was actively involved in society. People saw his selflessness and generosity during the day and heard his wise words and advice. At night, the stars saw his tears of devotion and the sky heard his passionate supplications. He was both a mufti and a philosopher, a mystic and a social leader, an ascetic and a soldier, a judge and a worker, an orator and a writer. Ultimately, he was the complete human being, with all of his beautiful traits. Ali is a personality of opposites, and his speech is the same. In his words, there is mysticism at the height of mysticism, philosophy at the height of philosophy, freedom at the height of freedom, epic heroism at the height of heroism, and ethics at the height of ethics. Nahj al-Balagha, like Ali himself, is comprehensive. Imam Ali is the perfect human being because all of humanity's values have grown in him at their highest level and in perfect harmony. The words that come from Imam Ali can only be those of someone who has experienced all stages of spiritual journey and is fully aware of its secrets. Love for Ali means loving a balanced and harmonious soul, loving the perfect human being, loving the perfection of humanity, and loving what God and His Messenger call for.

BAD PREACHING THAT LED A GIRL ASTRAY

Once, I read a foreign story about a very religious girl. A prince, who was a hedonistic man, deeply admired her. He wanted to trap her, but this girl, with her purity and commitment to religion, wouldn't succumb to his advances, no matter what he did to deceive her. Time passed, and one day, this prince received a message from the girl, indicating that she was now willing to spend time with him. He was shocked and decided to investigate what had caused this sudden change in her. It turned out that a priest, recognizing her religious nature, thought that he could make her even more religious by offering a "gift." He brought a wrapped cloth to her, and when she unwrapped it, she discovered a decayed human skull from a graveyard. The priest explained, "I brought this to make you reflect on how transient and unfaithful the world is!" Instead of inspiring religious thought, the girl was so disgusted that it caused her to turn away from her piety. From that point on, she thought to herself, "If this world ends up like this, then why should I waste my life in such a miserable existence?" She became drawn toward indulgence and pleasure. This is one way of preaching, one form of advice. And believe me, many forms of advice and moral guidance, especially those involving commands to do good and avoid wrong, can be in themselves quite misguided.

IMAM ALI'S COMMAND TO MALIK AL-ASHTAR

In his letter to Malik al-Ashtar, when he appointed him as the governor of Egypt, Imam Ali advises him on how to treat the people: "And make your heart feel mercy for the people, love for them, and kindness toward them... And grant them your forgiveness and pardon just as you would wish Allah to grant you His forgiveness and pardon." The ruler's heart must be a center of love and kindness toward the people. Power and force alone are not enough. With power and force, people can be controlled like sheep, but it is not possible to awaken and harness their hidden potential. Not only is power and force insufficient, but even if justice is implemented rigidly, it is not enough. The ruler, like a kind father, must genuinely love the people and show them affection. He should also possess a personality that attracts love and devotion, so he can mobilize their will, energy, and immense human resources to serve the sacred goal.

LACK OF SURRENDER DUE TO STUBBORNNESS

When the purpose comes, the art is hidden; a hundred veils appear from the heart to the eyes. The effect of having a biased and stubborn attitude is truly astonishing! The word "Islam," which is the name of God's religion, is itself a miracle. It defines the spirit of religion and humanity and distinguishes the boundary between disbelief and faith. Islam means that a person should be submissive to the truth when it is presented to them. If stubbornness takes over, nothing will work in a person anymore.

SEEKING DIVINE BLESSINGS IN LIFE

While other creatures are under the control of the natural laws of the world, it is humanity that, due to intellectual growth, has freedom and choice. Humans can choose between two paths: "Indeed, We have guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful." Both the straight path and the wrong path are set before humanity. If one chooses the straight path, the path of divine truth, it is then that they experience special mercy and grace from God. It is as though the world is constructed in a way that anyone who follows God's path will be assisted by God — guiding them, illuminating their heart, energizing their spirit, providing provisions from unexpected sources, and ultimately reaching a point where they feel they are in a direct relationship with God. They see that the more they act with sincerity, the more God's blessings and kindness flow into their lives. At that point, they reach the stage of acceptance and submission to God's will.

COMPARISON BETWEEN PROPHET MUHAMMAD AND IMAM HUSSAIN

The Messenger of God took on the responsibility of awakening a sleeping society and leading it. Imam Hussain rose to correct the path of a misguided society. Both demonstrated the highest level of competence and qualification in leadership. Prophet Muhammad led a message, an ideology, and mobilized the necessary forces to spread a divine message to the world, breaking both mental and social chains. On the other hand, Imam Hussain led a sacred revolution against tyranny, hypocrisy, lies, and deceit. He initiated an uprising for enjoining good and forbidding wrong, leading a reformist movement.

FORGIVENESS VERSUS PARDON

Anas ibn Malik used to serve in the house of the Prophet. He mentions that the Prophet often fasted, and after fasting, he would have very simple food, whether for Suhoor pre-dawn meal or Iftar meal to break the fast. Usually, his Iftar consisted of just some milk, which Anas would prepare. One night, the Prophet returned home very late, so late that Anas thought he must have had Iftar at the house of one of his companions. Anas ate the milk himself and then went to sleep. When the Prophet returned, Anas felt that he had not yet broken his fast. Apparently, Anas asked someone whether the Prophet had been a guest that evening, and he was told no. There was nothing else available, so Anas hid himself. When the Prophet saw there was nothing to eat, he went to sleep. Anas later narrates that the Prophet never once mentioned this incident to him while he was alive. This is what is known as pardon. The Quran commands us to forgive and to pardon. Pardon is different from forgiveness. When someone commits a wrong, they deserve both punishment and reproach. Forgiveness is refraining from punishment, but pardon is a higher level. Pardon is when a person not only refrains from punishing but also does not even mention the wrongdoer's name or bring it up. Therefore, the saints of Allah always possess a rank higher than mere forgiveness, and their forgiveness is in the form of pardon.

THE EFFECT OF CONSISTENCY IN WORSHIP

Sometimes, the effect is minimal, why? Performing a recommended prayer or giving charity once may not have a lasting impact. This happens because sometimes a person acts under the influence of a temporary state. For example, a preacher may speak in a compelling way, and in that moment, the person feels inspired to pray or act in a certain way. They may, for instance, pray many units of prayer in one sitting, but once that temporary state fades, they might not engage in that act for years. Similarly, a person may be influenced by someone's words and suddenly feel generous, giving away a significant portion of their wealth. But this generosity might only last for that one instance, driven by a temporary emotional impulse, which lacks depth. In contrast, when someone consistently engages in an act, it reflects their genuine choice and comes from the depths of their soul, not because they were temporarily influenced by someone else.

THE GREAT SPIRIT OF IMAM HUSSAIN

Imam Hussein is a noble soul, a sacred spirit. When the spirit grows, the body is destined to endure hardships, but when the spirit is small, the body seeks comfort. This is a profound truth. Even if Ibn Abbas and others advise, can the spirit of Hussein be constrained by such advice? The famous Arab poet, Al-Mutanabbi, expresses it well in a verse: when the soul is great, the body has no choice but to follow it, enduring hardship and difficulty. But a small soul follows the desires of the body, obeying its every command. A small soul seeks food for the body, even if it must beg or flatter to obtain it. A small soul will compromise its honor for status or comfort, willing to endure disgrace just for a better lifestyle. But a great soul feeds the body with simple food and then tells it to rise and stay awake in devotion. A great soul feels the slightest neglect of its duty and commands the body to endure hardships to feel the suffering of the needy, so as not to fail them. A great soul dreams of martyrdom for the sake of God's divine goals, and when it faces hardship, it thanks God. When the soul is great, it is inevitable that on Ashura, the body will endure hundreds of wounds. The body crushed beneath hooves of horses pays the price for such a great soul—paying for a historic sacrifice, for seeking truth, and for the martyrdom of a righteous spirit.

THE STATUS OF HAZRAT ABBAS

Our Imams have said: "Indeed, Al-Abbas has a status with Allah that all the martyrs will envy him for on the Day of Judgment." Hazrat Abul-Fadl al-Abbas holds a special rank with Allah, one that all the martyrs will covet on the Day of Judgment. Unfortunately, history does not provide much detailed information about the life of this great person Hazrat Abul-Fadl al-Abbas. So, if one wants to write a book about his life, they may find very little material. But what good is a lot of material? Sometimes, a short life—a day, two days, or even five days—may shine so brightly that it could outweigh dozens of books in proving the value of that individual. And Hazrat Abul-Fadl al-Abbas was such a person.

THE BELIEVER'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD

Religious faith shapes a person's view of the world by presenting creation as purposeful, with the goal being goodness, growth, and happiness. Naturally, this leads to a positive outlook on the universe and the laws governing it. For a believer, their position in the grand scheme of existence is similar to that of a citizen in a country with just, fair laws and benevolent leaders. They trust in the system and believe that the path to progress and improvement is open to them and others. They are convinced that the only thing that might hold them back is their own laziness or lack of experience, or that of those who are similarly responsible. From the believer's perspective, any setback or failure is their own fault. This mindset leads to a sense of responsibility and a proactive attitude, driving them forward with optimism and energy. In contrast, a non-believer views the world as a place governed by corrupt and unjust systems. They may feel trapped by circumstances, and their internal state is often filled with frustration and resentment. They don't think about self-improvement but instead believe that in a world full of chaos and injustice, individual efforts have little impact. For such a person, the world feels like a dreadful prison. This is why the Quran says: "And whoever turns away from My remembrance, indeed, he will have a depressed life." Indeed, it is faith that expands the heart and soul, freeing one from the pressures of spiritual burdens.

THE TRUE MEANING OF AWAITING THE MAHDI

The type of misinterpretation of awaiting the advent of Imam Mahdi may Allah hasten his reappearance that leads to neglecting Islamic laws and a kind of "permissiveness" is in no way compatible with the principles of Islam and the Quran. Martyr Motahhari emphasizes that according to the Quran, the reappearance of Imam Mahdi is a continuation of the eternal struggle between truth and falsehood, culminating in the final victory of the truth. A person can only take part in this victory if they are actively involved in the camp of truth, characterized by faith and righteous deeds. The Quran states: "Allah has promised those of you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession to authority upon the earth... and that He will establish for them their religion... and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security." Another verse says: "And We wanted to bestow favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors of the earth." The Quran also says: "Indeed, We have written in the Psalms after the previous mention that the land is inherited by My righteous servants." And: "Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the best outcome is for the righteous." Therefore, true awaiting means preparing the ground for the Imam's reappearance through action, effort, reform, piety, and upholding Islamic values—not by passivity or neglect.

THE ASTONISHING NATURE OF THE HUMAN HEART

The Quran describes the human being as a creature in constant change and transformation. The term "heart" qalb in Arabic is used precisely because it implies this flipping, turning, and transformation. Of course, it's clear that the "heart" here doesn't refer to the physical organ in the left side of the chest, but rather to the human soul and inner being, which is always undergoing new states and conditions. The Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said: "The example of the heart is like a feather in the middle of a desert, hanging from a tree, which the wind constantly turns over from side to side." This saying is reflected in Rumi's Masnavi: The Prophet said, the heart is like a feather, In a desert caught in a whirlwind's tether, The wind drives it this way and that again, Left or right, with a hundred shifts of plane. A person is never in the same state from one moment to the next, and nothing influences them more than their own actions. A luminous deed gives the heart light and spiritual clarity, while a sinful or dark deed removes this light and fills the heart with darkness. A righteous action softens the heart and makes it receptive to advice, truth, and divine guidance. In contrast, actions that oppose human nature—selfishness, dishonesty, cruelty—lead to hardness of heart. Sometimes the heart becomes so darkened that, as the Quran says, it's as if the person is sealed off from truth: "A seal has been set upon their hearts and their hearing, and over their eyes is a veil."

WHY ARE THE WEALTHY MORE PRONE TO ADDICTION

Why is it that in the upper classes and among the wealthy, addiction to opium, alcohol, and gambling is more prevalent than in other social classes? The reason is that the initial driving force that leads a person toward these things is the desire to be distracted and relieved from life's burdens and worries. Research and studies by scholars have shown that it is usually those who suffer from mental distress and inner anxiety, whose peace of mind has been disturbed by waves of sorrow and depression, who turn to these harmful substances and behaviors. They do so in order to at least temporarily free themselves from troubling thoughts: They use narcotics to numb their nerves, Or they drink alcohol to temporarily dismiss the "king of reason" their intellect, Or they gamble, because the intense excitement of gambling blocks out thought for a while. Eventually, these acts become repeated, turn into habits, and bring about the worst kinds of harm to both their bodies and their souls.

WHY DOES GOD AFFLICT HUMANS WITH TRIALS

This question naturally arises in every person's mind: How can God's love, mercy, and satisfaction with someone lead to exposing them to hardship and suffering? Isn't the natural result of love and kindness to provide comfort and ease, rather than pain and difficulty? Another concept in the Quran and Islamic tradition deepens the question: the idea of "trial." God tests His servants through afflictions and calamities. But why? Isn't God fully aware of everyone's inner self? Doesn't the Quran itself state that nothing in the universe—no movement, no atom—is hidden from God? So what's the point of a "test"? The answer to both questions becomes clear when we understand the purpose and effects of hardships in a person's life. According to the laws of creation, many of the most valuable human perfections cannot be attained except through struggle, difficulty, resistance, and confrontation with suffering. It's not just that hardships reveal what already lies hidden inside a person like uncovering a buried treasure. Hardships do more than reveal—they transform. They refine, build, and elevate a person. Just like a metal undergoes transformation in a furnace, trials can turn weakness into strength, immaturity into wisdom, and base character into nobility. They purify the soul, removing rust and corruption. They awaken a person, eliminate laziness, and stimulate spiritual and moral growth. So we must not mistake hardships as divine wrath. They are, in truth, mercy disguised as challenge, blessing in the form of trial, and goodness hidden beneath what seems to be evil.

THE RULE OF WILL IN THE HEREAFTER

Life in this world is governed by time limits, duration, and cause-and-effect relationships. It's clear that anything we want to create here must come about under certain conditions and within a specific time frame. For instance, if we want to grow wheat, it can only be cultivated under specific temporal conditions, with a particular waiting period. Of course, through scientific advancement we may be able to accelerate or slightly change this timeline, but the need for time and conditions remains essential. However, in the Next World Akhirah, goals and desires are not achieved in the same way. As mentioned in a hadith from the Prophet: "The world is the farm for the Hereafter." There, there's no concept of sowing, waiting, or growing through stages. The dominant principle in the Hereafter is the rule of will — what one wills, becomes. If someone reaches that world, whatever they will — and however they will it — comes into existence simply by their intention. The Quranic verse: "Therein you shall have whatever your souls desire and your eyes delight in" — along with other similar verses — implies that the governing law there is the rule of will. The human will in that world is not restricted by external conditions, time, or the limitations of movement and transformation. Mystics and philosophers have said that the Hereafter is not a world of movement, change, or development. It is a realm where what is willed, simply is.

HUMAN NATURE IS NOT VARIETY-SEEKING

This verse of the Quran is truly miraculous: "Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest." It clearly states that only through remembrance of God does the human heart attain tranquility. The ultimate and real goal that exists in human nature is nothing other than God. Therefore, whenever a person reaches anything other than God, the warmth of that attainment eventually turns into coldness and dissatisfaction. One of the great misconceptions is this: people think that human beings naturally seek variety. The truth is that variety is only sought when a person is chasing something unreal or superficial. If a thing is a true and ultimate goal, the soul does not grow tired of it. The Quran says: "They will not desire any change from it Paradise." In Paradise, the desire for change or variety disappears — because what the soul has attained is the true and ultimate object of desire.

IMPROPER FLEXIBILITY

One of the unjustified expectations placed on the idea of "adapting to the times" is when politicians label their fox-like opportunism — constantly shifting their colors based on the prevailing trends of society — as flexibility, adaptability, cleverness, or wisdom. They then demand that Islam validate this behavior. When it doesn't, they complain that Islam is flawed because it prevents people from "adjusting to the times." But in fact, one of Islam's great points of pride is that it prevents such opportunistic adaptations. Husayn ibn Ali — who rules over the hearts of believers today — did so precisely because he refused to conform to the color of the times. He didn't say, "If the Prophet rules, I'll adopt his color; if Mu'awiya rules, I'll adopt his; if Yazid rules, I must follow the time." He resisted going along with the corruption of his age. When Marwan ibn al-Hakam said to him: "O Aba Abdillah, I have some friendly advice for you." Imam Husayn replied, "Speak." He said: "I see your benefit lies in pledging allegiance to Yazid." But the Imam didn't say, "That's not in my personal interest." Instead, he replied: "Then peace be upon Islam, if the Ummah is to be tested with a ruler like Yazid." In other words: At that point, Islam must be considered lost.

WHY HAVE THE WORST ATROCITIES BEEN COMMITTED BY EXTREMISTS

In general, those who first adopt religion and later abandon it become harsher and more inhumane than those who never turned to religion at all. This is because religion, due to its immense power, dominates and absorbs all other human emotions. And when religion leaves a person, it takes those absorbed emotions with it. That is why formerly religious people who become irreligious are often more brutal, emotionless, and dangerous than those who were always irreligious. But even more dangerous than this group are misguided, narrow-minded, fanatical religious extremists. In these individuals, not only have normal human emotions been overshadowed by a distorted form of religious feeling, but the true, guiding power of religion has also become ineffective due to misdirection. And because this religious impulse is still present—though distorted—it continues to operate with the same intensity that genuine religious fervor would. These individuals are more dangerous and terrifying than any wild beast. History shows that the most ruthless wars, mass killings, tortures, and persecutions were committed by these fanatics. They are capable of the worst betrayals because they truly "believe they are doing good": "They think they are doing good deeds." The Crusades, the wars waged by the Khawarij, and even the tragedy of Karbala were all perpetrated by such misguided religious extremists.

WITH OVERSENSITIVITY ONE BECOMES NEITHER SERVANT NOR HUMAN

Get rid of your oversensitivity! A person who is delicate and pampered doesn't become a servant of God — in fact, he doesn't even become truly human. An oversensitive person is not truly a human being. Fasting is hard? Then fast — precisely because it's hard! Staying up all night in worship during the nights of Ramadan is difficult? Then do it — exactly because it's difficult! Go through some hardship for a while. Discipline yourself!

ISLAM IS NOT JUST SUBMISSION BUT ALSO REBELLION

The Quran states: "There is no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clearly from error. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut false gods/tyrants and believes in God has grasped the firmest handhold." It doesn't say, "Whoever believes in God," but rather, it pairs belief in God with disbelief in Taghut. The affirmation faith in God is inseparably linked with the negation rejection of false powers: "Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in God." Islam is not pure submission and obedience — it is also rebellion. But rebellion against what? Rebellion against desires, idols, and tyrants — against everything that is worshipped besides God. Islamic faith is not merely affirmation — it also requires denial. As the Quran says, it includes disbelief in Taghut. A person cannot attain true Islamic faith until they have passed through this disbelief in falsehoods. One's connection to God will not be strong and unshakable until all other false ties are severed. True servitude to God is only possible through liberation from everything besides Him . As the poet says: You cannot be a servant until you become free, You cannot fill a cup that is already full. One must first become free in order to become a servant of God. Only after cutting off all other attachments can one strengthen their bond with God Almighty. One must disbelieve in Taghut to prepare the ground for true faith in God. That is why the Quran says: "Whoever repents and reforms." First comes repentance, then comes transformation.

STRONG VERSUS WEAK GOVERNANCE

In weak governments, the law is weak and the individual is strong. Such a system is ruled by personal interests, bribery, nepotism, and influence-peddling. The rule of law — which should represent the common good — becomes ineffective and powerless. Naturally, such a country will lack strength and vitality. No matter how rich it may be in natural resources, talent, or capital, it ends up weak, insignificant, and miserable. The Quran presents a powerful analogy: "God sets forth a parable: a man owned by quarreling partners, and another man devoted entirely to one master — are they equal in comparison?" Just as unity and clear leadership give power, fragmentation and conflicting influences cause weakness. The same principle applies to inner governance within the human being. A strong inner government is one where reason rules, and the chaotic domination of desire, anger, and delusion is subdued. A truly strong government is one that is: Secure internally with order and stability, Independent externally, free from foreign domination or influence. Likewise, a strong human personality — spiritually and mentally — is one that: Possesses inner strength discipline, control, Is independent in thought and will, Not weak, spineless, a blind follower, or someone easily manipulated.A FAMOUS BUT INCORRECT PRAYERA man once prayed in the presence of Imam Ali saying: "O God, do not make me dependent on Your creation!" Imam Ali replied: "Do not say it like that." The man asked: "Then how should I say it?" Imam replied: "Say: O God, do not make me dependent on the wicked among Your creation!" The reason is that the first sentence is impossible to realize. The nature of human creation is such that we are always in need of others in order to manage and advance our worldly life. Even the phrase "You alone we seek help from" in the Quran does not mean we shouldn't ask for help from others. So, what does it mean? The key point of this verse is: Your ultimate trust and the true anchor of your heart must be God. All other sources of help — people, your own strength, your intellect — should be seen merely as means that God has created and placed at your disposal. He alone holds the reins. Often we trust in means and tools around us, only to be disappointed — they fail to help us when we need them most. At times, we even trust our own abilities, yet find them failing us. Only God's power is such that, if one truly relies on Him and organizes their life in alignment with His will, they will never be left anxious or unsupported.WHY DID MARTYR MOTAHHARI PICK UP THE PENSince about twenty years ago, when I began writing, whether it was an article or a book, the only thing I consistently aimed for in all my writings has been to solve problems and respond to questions related to Islamic issues in our era. My writings vary — some are philosophical, some social, ethical, jurisprudential, or historical. Though the subjects are vastly different, they all share one overarching goal. The sacred religion of Islam is largely misunderstood. Its truths have gradually been distorted in people's minds, and one of the main reasons some have turned away from religion is due to the false teachings that are wrongly attributed to it. Today, this noble religion suffers more from those who claim to support it than from its declared enemies. The assault of Western colonialism — with its visible and invisible tools — on the one hand, and the negligence or shortcomings of many of those claiming to defend Islam on the other, have left Islamic ideas — from principles to practical rulings — vulnerable to attack. That is why I have considered it my duty to contribute, within my capacity, to defending and clarifying Islamic thought.BOTH GOD SAYS READ AND MODERN CIVILIZATION"Read in the name of your Lord who created." Read, but in the name of your Lord, with the help and invocation of your Lord, the Creator. This verse represents the spirit of Islamic culture. Islam says, "Read!" Modern Western civilization also says, "Read and write!" Western civilization says fight illiteracy, and the Quran also says fight illiteracy. "Iqra" means fighting illiteracy. But the Quran says: Read in the name of your Lord; it wants reading and knowing to be combined with spirituality, faith, and always accompanied by God's name. Islam does not believe in a culture separate from faith, and experience has shown that such a culture does nothing for humanity. A culture disconnected from faith, "Iqra" separated from "In the name of your Lord who created", is a culture that can go to the moon but simultaneously drop bombs on innocent people in their homes; it is not humanity. "Read" separated from "In the name of your Lord who created" and from God's name is barbarism and creates savagery for humanity; knowledge becomes a tool for satisfying human greed and lust. Knowledge separate from faith, reading and writing separate from faith, literacy separate from faith, does not make a person human and does not give humanity to humans. Instead, it gives tools to humans — in whatever form it takes. The spirit of Islamic culture is the union of knowledge and faith. "And those who are given knowledge and faith." The Quran speaks of knowledge and faith together, not faith minus knowledge, nor knowledge minus faith. The famous poet Mulla of Rome beautifully expresses this truth: "Whoever moves without a head is a madman, His movement like that of a scorpion. Knowledge, wealth, position, and Quran, Bring turmoil in the hands of bad-hearted ones. Giving a sword to a drunken man, Better to see it in the hands of a fool." The biggest mistake today among us Muslims is that we are seeking knowledge without faith and want to imitate the West. We want to bring knowledge into our country through one door, but throw out faith from the other door. What difference does it make: whether we lack knowledge and have faith, or we have knowledge but lack faith? We are like a pigeon with one wing. A human must fly with two wings: knowledge and faith.IS DOUBT IN BELIEFS GOOD OR BADDoubt is restlessness, but not all peace is better than this restlessness. An animal does not doubt, but has it reached the level of faith and certainty?! That type of peace is a lower form of peace compared to the peace of the people of certainty, which is above doubt. Aside from the few individuals who are divinely supported, others who are of certainty have passed through the stage of doubt and uncertainty to reach the destination of faith and conviction. Therefore, simply because our era is an era of doubt should not be seen as a sign of decline and deviation of our time. Certainly, this type of doubt is not inferior to the simple and naïve peace that is often seen. What can be regrettable is when an individual's doubt does not lead them toward research, or when social doubts do not motivate individuals to respond to the societal needs in this regard.

BEING ALONE WITH A NON-MAHRAM WOMAN

Many miracles have been attributed to the late Muqaddas Ardebili. However, it is also said that he was once asked: "If you were in a place where there was a beautiful non-mahram woman, and you were completely alone, and no one besides God would know, and you were absolutely certain of the outcome, what would you do?" He replied: "I seek refuge in God." He did not say, "I trust myself." Instead, he said: "I seek refuge in God," meaning he did not rely on his own strength. A true mystic, one who knows himself and his Lord, responds in such a way.LIBERATION FROM WORLDLY ATTACHMENTSImam Sadiq said: When a believer is freed from the burdens of attachment to this world, he feels the sweetness of God's love in his heart. At this moment, it is as though the earth becomes too small for him, and with his entire being, he desires to be liberated from this material world and to transcend it. This is a truth that the friends of God and the men of piety have proven with their lives.PRAYER AS A CLASSPrayer is a class in which we are the teacher, and our heart is the student, but it often skips the class.SUGGESTED TERMS ON EXTREMISM AND RIGIDITYOne of the great qualities of the sacred religion of Islam is moderation and balance. The Quran itself refers to the Muslim community as the "middle nation," and this expression is truly extraordinary and remarkable. A community that is genuinely and truly nurtured by the Quran is free from extremism, negligence, rashness, and undue caution, whether it is extreme in the left or the right. The education provided by the Quran always requires moderation and balance. Regarding adapting to the needs of the time, some of the intellectual currents in the Islamic world have arisen due to this issue. Some have been extremist, and others have been negligent, meaning either unwarranted extremism or unwarranted caution.

Mr. Rashid narrated that in the year 1318 1939, when his father had come to Tehran, sometimes when they were walking down the street and someone would point out something to him, like saying: "They've ruined this street," or "Look at this place," he wouldn't raise his head or look around. Mr. Rashid asked his father: "Why don't you look?" He replied: "Because it doesn't benefit me. Just as much as I look, my attention is drawn, and that thing comes into my soul and becomes food for my spirit. I need to assess whether this spiritual food is necessary for me or not, whether it is beneficial or not."OUR ERA OF HYPOCRISYOur era is the era of hypocrisy, duality, the distance between heart and tongue, appearance and reality, and claims and actions.

This person becomes a multi-personality being. In contrast, the one who has one beloved and one goal wants everything in line with that goal. This doesn't mean they don't desire other things, but they want everything in the service of that one purpose.WHAT IS THE NIGHT OF QADRThe Night of Qadr is a night when a connection is established between the earth and the heavens, between the material and the metaphysical.

Instead, your desire shifts entirely toward pure and righteous actions.THE MEANING OF REVIVING THE NIGHTThese nights are called "Layali al-Ihya" — the nights of revival. The word "Ihya" means to give life, or to keep alive. When a person spends the night like a corpse — eats at the beginning of the night, then due to fatigue, laziness, and fullness, lies down until morning like a lifeless body merely breathing — such a person is spiritually dead, and naturally, their night is also dead. To keep the night alive means that a person is spiritually alive during the night — that is, they have inner life. This spiritual life comes through remembrance of God. To whatever extent the heart is not heedless of God, a person is considered spiritually alive. Their day is alive, and their night is alive too.JUSTICE AND EQUALITYJustice does not require the elimination of all differences between individuals; true justice lies in respecting people's rightful entitlements.

LIBERATION FROM WORLDLY ATTACHMENTS

Imam Sadiq said: When a believer is freed from the burdens of attachment to this world, he feels the sweetness of God's love in his heart. At this moment, it is as though the earth becomes too small for him, and with his entire being, he desires to be liberated from this material world and to transcend it.

JUSTICE AND EQUALITY

Justice does not require the elimination of all differences between individuals; true justice lies in respecting people's rightful entitlements.

DO NOT USE INSULTS

The Messenger of Allah said: "Do not use insults! If insults were to take form, they would have the worst and ugliest appearance." Aisha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah, was sitting with him when a Jewish man entered. Instead of greeting with "As-Salaam Alaikum" Peace be upon you, he said, "Al-Saam Alaikum" Death be upon you. Soon after, another man entered and did the same, indicating it wasn't a coincidence but a deliberate attempt to insult the Prophet with their words. Aisha became very angry and shouted, "Death be upon you and..." The Messenger of Allah replied: "O Aisha! Do not use insults. If insults were to take form, they would have the worst and ugliest appearance. Kindness, gentleness, and patience, when applied to anything, make it beautiful and adorn it; but when removed from anything, it diminishes its beauty. Why are you angry and upset?" Aisha replied, "Don't you see, O Messenger of Allah, how shamelessly they speak in place of greeting us with peace?" "Yes, but in response, I said: 'Alaikum' upon yourselves. That was enough.

A POLITE INSULT TO ISLAM

The issue presented under the term "separation of religion from politics" is a respectful title; it is a polite insult to Islam, as it does not address the needs of today's world.

THE SHIA BELIEF IN THE EVER-PRESENT HUJJAH

According to Shia belief, at all times, there exists a "complete human being" who has a spiritual influence over the world and humanity, and is a guardian over the souls, spirits, and hearts. This individual also possesses a certain type of divine control over the universe and human beings. For this reason, their title is "Hujjah" Proof.

WITH ALL THE ADVANCEMENTS HOW CAN AN OLD RELIGION

it is true that human living conditions are variable and human needs change, but the matter is not that simple. Humanity has both constant and ever-changing needs. Not all human needs are variable. Needs related to the meaning of human life are constant, while those related to the form and appearance of human life are changing and evolving. You cannot use the fact that the form of life constantly changes as a reason to say that the essence of life must also change. Religious matters concern the essence of life, not its form.

THE BALANCE OF SELF-BUILDING AND SOCIETY-BUILDING

Unfortunately, in our society today, most of those who have an Islamic fervor belong to two groups: one group... for them, Islam is only about remembrance, prayer, reciting the Nafila voluntary prayers, going on pilgrimages, and reciting Ziyarat Ashura... They have no concern with the world, no concern with life, no concern with the social laws of Islam, no concern with the principles and pillars of Islam, no concern with Islamic education. They are entirely indifferent to all of these matters. The opposite reaction to this is the emergence of another group of extremists who genuinely care about the social issues of Islam and show sensitivity in this regard. These individuals are indeed valuable from this perspective. However, some of them I have seen, for example, are capable of going for Hajj but do not go, or they do not give importance to prayer, or they do not care about following Islamic jurisprudence. A true Muslim must maintain a constant and solid connection with both God and society. Without worship, remembrance, supplication, and the presence of heart in prayer and fasting, a truly Islamic society cannot be built, and even the individual cannot remain healthy. Likewise, without a virtuous society, a healthy environment, without enjoining good and forbidding evil, and without mutual care and compassion among Muslims, one cannot be a true worshipper.

RELIGION AND POLITICS INTERCONNECTION

The interconnection between religion and politics does not mean that religion is dependent on politics, but rather that politics should be dependent on religion.

DOUBT A GOOD PASSAGE BAD DESTINATION

Our era — especially for the younger generation — is a time of religious and spiritual uncertainty, hesitation, and crisis. The conditions of the modern age have created a series of doubts and questions, even reviving old and long-forgotten inquiries. Should we be distressed by these doubts, questions, and sometimes excessive inquisitiveness? In my opinion, not at all. Doubt is the prelude to certainty; questioning is the gateway to understanding; anxiety is the path to peace. Doubt is a necessary and beneficial passage, though it is an unsuitable place to settle. Islam, which so strongly emphasizes thinking and certainty, implicitly acknowledges that the natural state of human beings begins with ignorance and doubt — and that only through proper thought and reasoning can one reach the station of conviction and assurance. What should be a cause for concern is when an individual's doubt does not lead them toward investigation — or when widespread societal doubts fail to awaken people who are capable of addressing these needs.

SET ASIDE ONE HOUR FOR YOURSELF

The wise and great have always recommended: no matter how busy you are, dedicate at least one hour of your day for yourself. You might say, "I don't even have an hour to spare; all my time is spent serving others." But no — even if all your hours are devoted to serving God's creation, you still need time for yourself. That hour — or more — should be genuinely for yourself: a time to return inward, detach from everything external, and reconnect with your inner self and with God. In those moments, it should be just you and your Lord — whispering, praying, seeking forgiveness. Seeking forgiveness istighfar itself means self-accountability. It's to examine yourself and reflect: "What did I do in these past 24 hours?" At once it becomes clear: This deed was good — I thank God. That action I shouldn't have done — I resolve to avoid it and seek forgiveness.

TO AWAIT THE REAPPEARANCE

To await the reappearance Faraj truly means that we genuinely intend to stand alongside Imam Mahdi and assist him in reforming the world.

SPIRITUALITY THE BACKBONE OF JUSTICE

Without the wing of spirituality, the wing of justice cannot function. According to the Quran, spirituality is the foundation of true human development. All the emphasis Islam places on acts of worship is to strengthen the spiritual dimension of the human soul. Look at the life of the Prophet: despite his immense responsibilities and workload, still the Quran says: "God knows that you O Prophet stand in prayer nearly two-thirds of the night—sometimes half of it, or a third of it—and so do some of those with you." Or consider Imam Ali: if we admire his social justice, his laboring with the shovel, his sweat and service — we must also see those moments when he collapsed in the dead of night, unconscious out of awe and fear of God. In the future, our revolution will not only need Islamic-scale social justice, but also a deep and encompassing spirituality — the kind we witnessed in the Prophet and the Imams.

ALL PROPHETS CALLED TO MONOTHEISM

It is said that the late Sheikh Ja'far Shushtari once went up to the pulpit and said: "O people! All the prophets came to call you to monotheism. But I have come to call you to polytheism." Then he explained: "All the prophets said: worship only God, act solely for His sake. I say: at least do a little for God — meaning, don't let all your actions be purely for worldly or selfish purposes." Sometimes, a person uses God as a means to fulfill their own desires — even though God is mentioned, He is not the goal, only a tool. Still, such an act is a form of turning toward God's door — though it may be for worldly concerns. Undoubtedly, this is a kind of hidden shirk polytheism — where the act of worship turns God into a means rather than the end. Yet, the Almighty, in His mercy, still accepts these hidden forms of shirk to some extent and grants what the person seeks. The same applies to the afterlife. If a person performs worship only to gain paradise or avoid hell, God may still grant them that — but such worship is not true worship. In real worship, God is not a means to something else — He is the goal Himself. True worship, true sincerity ikhlas, is when God is worshipped for His own sake — not for any worldly or even otherworldly gain. Only this is pure and authentic devotion.

IMAM ALI'S RESPONSE I AM YOUR ENEMY

A man once approached Amir al-Mu'minin Ali, smiled and said: "O Commander of the Faithful! I love you." Imam Ali replied: "But I am your enemy." He didn't say: "You are lying," because the man was telling the truth — he did love Ali. The man asked, "Why?" Imam Ali answered: "Because of such-and-such action of yours. There was someone in need of learning the Quran, and it was your duty to teach him — yet you took money from him." Therefore, there is no contradiction in loving Imam Ali while doing things that make him dislike us. Love alone is not enough; our actions must also reflect his values.

WAITING FOR THE APPEARANCE AND OUR DUTIES

In waiting for the appearance of Imam al-Hujjah, no duty is waived from us, neither individual nor social duties. In Shiaism — and this belief is exclusive to the Shia world — you will not find a scholar who says that the expectation of the Imam's appearance exempts us from even a small duty. No duty is waived from us.

WHY ARE WE AFRAID OF DEATH

Fear of death is instinctive and natural to every living being. The thought and image of death are among the most terrifying. A human fears nothing as much as death—and in fact, most other fears ultimately stem from fear of death itself. We fear something because it might lead to death. If death were not a possibility, we would fear nothing at all. Even the strongest men in the world, when faced with the terrifying grasp of death, have confessed to their helplessness. They have been reduced, humbled, and even seen their thoughts and beliefs transformed. As long as death appears as annihilation, nonexistence, and obliteration, it inspires fear. What terrifies us is this very sense of nothingness, of being erased. But once death changes its appearance—once we see it as a transition or relocation—then it ceases to be frightening. Rather, for the righteous and God-conscious—those who walked only in the path of truth—death takes on a beautiful, even captivating face. Such people run toward death willingly, joyfully, as a meeting with the Beloved.

THE QURAN HONORS FEMALE SAINTS

The Quran seems to deliberately honor not only the great male saints, but also the great female saints—many of whom, in certain aspects, surpass even the male saints in rank and virtue.

MARTYR MOTAHHARI'S PRAISE FOR HASHEMI RAFSANJANII

will never forget—during the well-known episode involving the so-called "opportunists," when a faction of the Mujahedin-e Khalq officially broke away and declared their inclination toward Marxism, one of our friends said something that deeply struck me. We had a friend who was deeply devoted to the Mujahedin's cause. He was extraordinarily self-sacrificing, ready to give his life for the struggle—not just in support of the Mujahedin, but so fiercely opposed to the regime that I couldn't imagine anyone more committed. I personally witnessed how willing he was to give up his wealth and life for the cause. He would collect money from others and spend it fully in service of the movement. He was opposed to the regime, and because the Mujahedin were also opposed to it, he had a strong inclination toward them. At one point, I became concerned: I thought to myself—what if, after seeing this ideological shift toward Marxism, he downplays it and says: "It doesn't really matter. Even if they've adopted Marxist tendencies, we shouldn't criticize them right now—the important thing is the fight, the struggle." That worried me. But in a meeting I had with him where I asked his opinion, he said something I've never forgotten. He said: "We want justice only in the light of God. If there's no God, no mention of God or God-worship, then we want nothing to do with such justice—we renounce it.

NEGLECTING GOD LEADS TO SELF-NEGLECT

Neglecting God and being unaware of Him inevitably leads to neglecting and being unaware of oneself. Forgetting God results in forgetting oneself, and losing connection with God means losing oneself.

A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON HARDSHIPS

One of the key factors in perfecting the soul, refining morals, and awakening the hidden powers within a person is hardship, difficulty, and suffering. Such challenges act as driving forces that stimulate human potential. According to the divine laws of creation, many forms of human perfection can only be achieved through facing adversity, clashing with obstacles, struggling with challenges, and standing firm in the face of trials and tribulations. The impact of hardships isn't just that they reveal a person's true nature or inner worth—it goes further than that. Hardships and tribulations have the power to transform, refine, and uplift. They can turn weakness into strength, baseness into nobility, and rawness into maturity. Therefore, such trials should not be seen as a form of divine wrath or punishment. Rather, they are grace in the form of severity, goodness in the guise of hardship, and blessings appearing as affliction.

ISLAM'S ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE

Islam desires that non-Muslims should not have dominance or influence over Muslims. This goal can only be achieved when the Muslim nation is not economically dependent and does not have to extend its hand toward non-Muslims.

THE RARE ELIXIR OF OUR TIME

It is narrated in a hadith: Call people toward goodness—not with words, but through action and by taking the lead. Much has been said about truth, justice, fairness, generosity, piety, forgiveness, sacrifice, and freedom. In this regard, nothing is lacking—there are countless speeches and writings in every form and style. What is rarely found, however, is acting upon truth and living by justice and fairness. What is rarely found is genuine generosity and piety. What is like a philosopher's stone is the reality of sacrifice and forgiveness. The rare elixir is a soul that is truly free and liberated. That is why people give little weight to mere words, but they bow in respect before genuine action. When they encounter a person who truly does not deviate from truth and justice, who embraces piety, and who possesses a free and noble spirit, they are naturally humbled and drawn in.

MAHDISM IS NOT A CHILDISH WISH

Mahdism is not a childish wish — whose only aim is revenge — but a global philosophy.

FIRST FILL THE PIT OF DESIRE THEN JUDGE

One of the causes of error, as the Quran mentions, is following the nafs ego and personal desires, and being driven by bias or inner illness. As Rumi says: "When desire enters, virtue is veiled; A hundred veils fall from the heart upon the eyes." In any issue, until a person detaches themselves from bias and self-interest, they cannot think correctly. The intellect can only function properly in an environment where the ego is not involved. A famous story is often told about Allamah Hilli that serves as a fitting example: A legal question arose for Allamah Hilli regarding this issue in Islamic jurisprudence—If an animal dies in a well and causes contamination, what should be done with the water in the well? Coincidentally, at that time, an animal fell into the water well of Allamah Hilli's own house, and he needed to derive a ruling that would also apply to his personal situation. There were two possible rulings: To completely fill in the well and switch to another water source. To remove a specific quantity of water from the well, after which the remaining water would be considered usable and pure. Allamah Hilli realized that he could not issue an unbiased judgment in this matter, since his own benefit was involved. So he ordered the well to be completely filled in first—thus removing personal interest from the equation. Only after that, with peace of mind and no whispering of the ego, did he issue his verdict and religious ruling.

A BELIEVER'S VIEW OF THEIR SOUL

Imam Ali peace be upon him says: "A believer does not end the night or begin the morning except that he is suspicious of his own soul." A believer's trait is that no day passes into night, nor night into day, unless he views his nafs self/ego with suspicion. He always looks at his soul with a kind of distrust—like someone living next to a treacherous neighbor they cannot rely on, always worried that this neighbor might betray them. Imam Ali is saying: A believer must always regard their own soul as a potential traitor—untrustworthy, prone to deceit, and deserving of doubt and suspicion. The poet Sa'di echoes this same wisdom: "The wise sheikh, my guide and mentor Shihab, Gave me two pieces of advice upon the water: First, never trust your own ego. Second, never distrust others unjustly."

DO NOT LOOK AT LENGTH OF PRAYER

A narration states: "Do not look at the length of a person's bowing and prostration"— That is, do not be deceived by how long someone prolongs their bowing or prostration. These extended acts of worship may simply be out of habit, and if they were to stop, the person might even feel anxious. If you want to truly understand what kind of person someone is, test them in truthfulness and trustworthiness. Because being trustworthy and truthful is not something that comes out of habit—unlike prayer, which can.

ASCETICISM VERSUS MONASTICISM

Islam calls people to asceticism zuhd but condemns monasticism rahbanism. Both the ascetic and the monk avoid luxury and sensual pleasure, but the monk flees society and its commitments and responsibilities, considering them lowly and worldly matters, retreating to monasteries, caves, or mountains. Meanwhile, the ascetic turns toward society, its standards, ideals, responsibilities, and obligations. Both are hereafter-oriented, but the ascetic is a hereafter-oriented social being, while the monk is a hereafter-oriented social recluse. From the monk's perspective, this world and the hereafter are two entirely separate and unrelated realms; the account of happiness in this world is completely distinct and even contradictory to the account of happiness in the hereafter. Consequently, effective actions for worldly happiness are separate from those for the hereafter's happiness. However, in the ascetic's worldview, this world and the hereafter are interconnected; this world is the field for the hereafter. According to the ascetic, what brings order, prosperity, peace, security, and comfort to this life is the integration of hereafterly spiritual standards into worldly life. And what forms the basis for the happiness of the hereafter is the proper fulfillment of worldly commitments and responsibilities, accompanied by faith, purity, and piety.

THE DUTY OF PEOPLE IN HASTENING JUSTICE

It is true that global justice is like a life-giving force and has a metaphysical dimension. However, until obstacles are removed, this life will not manifest. Therefore, it is the duty of the people to struggle against these obstacles in order to hasten the emergence of absolute justice. In other words, unless people become truly seekers of perfection and absolute justice— sincerely and accompanied by effort—they will not attain that lofty, metaphysical goal.

THE SHIA PERSPECTIVE ON GHADIR

"O Messenger, convey what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message." Here, the tone is very intense. O Prophet! Convey what has been revealed to you, and if you don't, you have not conveyed the message of God. The verse indicates that the matter is so important that if the Prophet does not convey it, he has not conveyed the divine message at all. Surah Al-Ma'idah, agreed upon by both Shia and Sunni, is the last Surah revealed to the Prophet, and these verses are among the final revelations. The Shia ask, what is the matter so critical that if the Prophet does not convey it, everything else becomes null and void? There is no subject at the end of the Prophet's life that holds such importance that without it, nothing else counts. We say that this matter is the issue of leadership and Imamate, without which everything falls apart. Furthermore, the Shia cite words and narrations from Sunni sources that this verse was revealed at Ghadir Khumm.

ANYONE WITH A NOBLE SOUL IS DRAWN TO ALI

Anyone whose soul, thoughts, and character are truly noble, like that of Ali, will be drawn towards him.

ISLAMIC UNITY DOES NOT MEAN ABANDONING BELIEFS

The concept of Islamic unity does not mean that Islamic sects should abandon their fundamental beliefs or non-beliefs in order to form a common ground based only on shared points, neglecting their distinct characteristics. This approach is neither logical nor practical. Rather, it means that despite the differences in theology, jurisprudence, and other aspects, Islamic sects can unite and form a common front based on the many shared principles they hold, in order to stand together against the dangerous enemies of Islam.

THE VALUE OF LIFE'S CAPITAL

The Prophet Muhammad says: "O Abu Dharr! Beware of letting thoughts and desires make you postpone today's work until tomorrow, because you belong to today and today's wealth, not the wealth of the coming days. When you want to do something beneficial, necessary, and pleasing to God, do not delay it. O Abu Dharr! Be more stingy with your time than with your wealth." Imam Ali says: "Look how quickly days pass into months, months into years, and years into our lifetime. These days, months, weeks, and days are parts of our life that are taken away and become non-existent, and they cannot be restored or returned. The very same life that, in the last moments when death comes, we would be willing to give up all our wealth for even one more year, one more day, or one more hour to see this world, and in that day or hour, to make up for the lost opportunities." It is written about one of the righteous men that he had dug his own grave in his house. Sometimes, he would go and lie in it, and then he would remind himself, imagining that he was dead. He would beg: "Please, allow me to return to the world so that I can make up for the past I have lost." He imagined that his plea was accepted only for him, and he was allowed to return. In this way, that righteous man would give himself advice and admonition.

WE HAVE A FUTURE OF PERFECTION

We have a future ahead of us in which, according to Islam, intellects will reach perfection, justice, security, and true freedom will be established, and monotheism will emerge in its true form, illuminating the world.

EXPEDIENT LIES VERSUS SELF-SERVING LIES

There is a difference between an expedient lie and a self-serving lie. An expedient lie is one where the philosophy behind it has been lost, and the philosophy of truth is found instead; it is a lie used to save a truth. But a self-serving lie is one where a person lies for their own benefit. The concept of expediency should not be confused with the concept of self-interest. Expediency is centered around truth. Expediency and truth are like two brothers who never separate. Expediency means respecting the truth, not pursuing one's own profit, which is self-interest. Some people lie for their own benefit and claim it's an expedient lie. When asked why they lied, they say, "I lied for expedience." But this is not expediency, it is simply a lie, like any other lie.

NO ACTION IS LOST

The Holy Prophet said: "The world is the farm of the Hereafter." Everyone reaps the consequences of what they sow. No action in this world is ever lost or wasted; not only is it not lost or wasted, but it also penetrates into the soil of our own soul, into the soil of our society, and ultimately into the fertile ground of the universe, which is surrounded by thousands of factors. After some time, it sprouts and manifests itself.

AN INCORRECT INTERPRETATION OF WAITING FOR RELIEF

What does "The best of deeds is waiting for relief" mean? Some people mistakenly believe that when it is said the best of deeds is waiting for relief, it means we should expect Imam Mahdi may Allah hasten his appearance to emerge with a group of special companions 313 individuals and others who are not special. They will remove the enemies of Islam from the earth, establish full security, welfare, and freedom, and then tell us: "Now, go ahead!" They think this is the kind of relief they should expect, and then claim that waiting for relief is the best of deeds — meaning, sit back, let things be done, and then enjoy the benefits! No, waiting for relief means being ready to fight alongside the Imam, and sometimes sacrificing your life as a martyr. It means sincerely desiring to struggle in the path of truth, not waiting for others to complete the work while you come in at the end to reap the rewards!

MAN HIS OWN TRAINER

Amir al-Mu'minin Ali said: "Account for yourselves before you are accounted for, and weigh yourselves before you are weighed." One of the most beneficial and fruitful instructions is this one. Humans differ from other things that can be trained in that external trainers alone are not enough for their upbringing. Everyone must develop a sense of self-coaching; they should have two personalities: From one perspective, they should be a commander and from another, a follower. From one side, they should give advice, and from another, they should accept advice. From one view, they should rebuke, and from another, they should accept rebuke. From one perspective, they should hold themselves accountable, and from another, they should be accountable to others. In the Quran, there is mention of the "Nafs Lawwama" the self-blaming soul. This refers to the soul that blames and tortures a person when they commit a mistake, causing inner conflict and self-reproach.

THE INFANT OF ABA ABDULLAH

Imam Hussein did not write his message on a stone or carve it into something; what he said echoed in the trembling air and in the ears of people, but it was engraved in hearts in such a way that it cannot be removed. On the Day of Ashura, in those final moments, Imam Hussein was calling for help, still asking for supporters—not to save him, but for supporters who would come to be martyred, just as his companions, brothers, and children had been. After their martyrdom, Imam Hussein no longer wished to live but still sought those who would come and be martyred. Thus, he called: "Is there anyone to help me?" At that moment, they brought his infant child to him. The infant was in the arms of his sister, Zainab, the noble sister of Aba Abdullah. Imam Hussein took the child into his arms. He did not ask, "Sister, why have you brought this child into this chaos, where there is no security and arrows are flying from all directions?" Instead, he held the child in his arms, and at that moment, an arrow struck the child's throat. What did Imam Hussein do? How did he respond? He scooped up a handful of the child's blood and threw it towards the sky, saying, "O sky, witness this!" In the final moments, when many blows had been struck upon Imam Hussein and he was already falling to the ground, moving on his knees, he was struck with a blow to his throat. It is written that once again, he filled his hand with blood, wiped it on his face, and said, "I am going to meet my Lord." These are the moving scenes from the plains of Karbala, events that forever preserve and cement the message of Imam Hussein in the world.

THE GRANDEUR OF KARBALA

Usually, when preachers want to emphasize the greatness of the Karbala event, they focus on its tragic aspects, on the cruelty and oppression, often even exaggerating or fabricating the tragedies. Through various expressions, comparisons, and illustrations, they intensify the sense of catastrophe. However, we should ask ourselves: What is the true greatness of the Karbala incident? Is it in its horror? Certainly, this tragedy is one of a kind, but similar or even greater tragedies have occurred in the world. The greatness of Karbala lies in the figures of Imam Hussein and his companions, not in the figures of Ibn Ziyad, Ibn Sa'd, and their followers. The greatness of Karbala is in the bliss and spiritual success, not in the wretchedness of the oppressors. Karbala, more than being a showcase of cruelty, wickedness, and the manifestation of humanity's darkness, is a display of spirituality, moral excellence, and sublime humanity. Sadly, preachers often overlook this aspect. In other words, the focus should be on the fact that Imam Hussein, Abu al-Fadl, and Zaynab are the real heroes of the story, not on figures like Shimmer and Sinan.

THE EPIC CREATED BY IMAM ZAIN AL-ABIDIN

On a Friday in Shaam, there was the Friday prayer, which Yazid was compelled to attend. The preacher, who was ordered to speak, praised Yazid and Muawiya immensely, mentioning all the good qualities in the world for them, and then began cursing Imam Ali and Imam Hussein, claiming they had gone astray and left the religion of God. Imam Zain al-Abidin from the foot of the pulpit shouted: "O preacher! You have bought the pleasure of the creature at the cost of the wrath of the Creator!" Then, he addressed Yazid, asking if he was allowed to speak for a moment from the pulpit. Yazid refused. Those around him, since Imam Zain al-Abidin was from Hijaz and the people of Hijaz were known for their eloquence, requested permission to hear him speak, saying it wouldn't harm anything. After much insistence, Yazid allowed him, although reluctantly, fearing what might happen. Despite being ill and having traveled forty stages in chains and shackles to reach Shaam, Imam Zain al-Abidin created an uproar when he ascended the pulpit! Yazid panicked, realizing that the people might rise against him. Yazid then resorted to a trick. It was noon, and he suddenly ordered the muezzin to call the adhan, claiming it was time for prayer. The muezzin began: "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar" and Imam Zain al-Abidin repeated the words after him. As the muezzin continued, Imam echoed every word, until the declaration of the Prophet's prophethood. Then, Imam Zain al-Abidin shouted: "Muezzin! Silence! Who is this whose name is mentioned here, and whose prophethood is being testified to? O people! Who are we, whom you have brought into captivity? Who was my father, whom you martyred? And who is this whose prophethood you testify to?" Until that moment, the people were unaware of the enormity of what had transpired. This led Yazid to change his course. Later, he ordered the family of the Prophet to be treated with respect and sent them back with care. He even appointed a more compassionate person, Nu'man ibn Bashir, to accompany them, urging kindness towards them. Why did this happen? Did Yazid suddenly become noble? Did his spirit change? Absolutely not. The environment and world of Yazid changed. Afterward, Yazid even began cursing Ibn Ziyad, claiming that it was entirely his fault and denying that he had given such orders. Why? Because Imam Zain al-Abidin and Zaynab had reversed the situation.

THE INJUSTICE TO ONESELF

A man wrote to one of the companions of the Prophet asking for advice. The companion replied: "Do not wrong the one whom you love the most." The man did not understand the meaning of this statement and asked for an explanation, wondering how it is possible to love someone deeply and then do harm to them. The companion responded: "Yes, it is possible. The person whom you love the most is yourself. Out of ignorance, you harm yourself, thinking that you are benefiting yourself. All the sins you commit, you do so in the belief that they bring you pleasure or benefit, but in reality, they are nothing but acts of hostility and harm to your own self." This is why the Quran often calls human beings "wrongdoers to themselves," because either out of ignorance or due to the arrogance of desires, they commit injustices against their own intellect, heart, and humanity.

WHAT DOES ECONOMIC POVERTY DO

Poverty and need—regardless of the cause, whether it be injustice or other reasons—are among the factors that lead to sin. When poverty is combined with a sense of being wronged and deprived, it becomes even worse. If it is also coupled with the resentment of the luxury and excess enjoyed by a few, it becomes even more dangerous. Poverty leads to theft, bribery, embezzlement, and betrayal of public trust. It leads to dishonesty, fraud, and corruption. People, in their desperation, may resort to bribery, theft, and taking advantage of others just to improve their own situation. Poverty, especially for those with weak faith, quickly pushes them toward sin. Many sins originate from poverty and need. This is why the Prophet Muhammad said: "Poverty is close to disbelief." Poverty weakens the spirit and makes a person's resolve frail.

OUR RELIGIOUS DUTY WHEN HEARING RUMORS

If someone speaks about an individual or an institution, what is our duty? Should we remain silent? No. Should we say, "We don't know, only God knows," or "I don't know, it might be true, might not be"? No. Should we spread these rumors and say, "This is what they are saying"? Absolutely not. So, what should we do? As long as a valid legal proof has not been established and it hasn't been proven to us according to Islamic law, we must say it's a lie. If someone says it, we should say: it's a lie. Not only should we not spread it, but we should also actively deny it when others speak of it. Once something is proven by Islamic law, then we have a duty. In some cases, we must fight it; in some cases, the Islamic ruler must fulfill their responsibility, such as in the case of adultery.

FOR A TRUE WORSHIPPER WORSHIP IS A COVENANT

For a true worshipper, worship is a "covenant," and the scene of life is fulfilling the covenant.

ISLAM'S STRATEGY FOR FIGHTING INJUSTICE

Did Islam only say to the oppressor: "O oppressor! Do not oppress"? Do all oppressors listen? Many oppressors do not listen. So, what does Islam do? It removes the ground for accepting oppression. It tells the oppressed: "O oppressed one! To submit to oppression is itself a form of oppression. Stand up to the oppressor with defiance." Allah does not like publicizing bad deeds unless someone has been wronged. The Quran says that gossiping about a Muslim behind their back speaking ill of them is bad, and it is worse when someone shouts while doing so. But in one case, this negativity becomes permissible: when you are the victim of injustice, speak out! Shout! Complain when you have been wronged.

SIGNS OF A DEAD SOCIETY

One of the signs of a dead society is being preoccupied with the past and its glories. Attention to the past is important, but it should be to the extent that it serves as the foundation for building the future, not as a mere distraction for the present time.

HOPE AND DESIRE IN AWAITING

In waiting for the emergence, there are two elements: one is hope, and the other is desire. Hope, in this context, means that your spirit does not break under the onslaught of the forces of falsehood, that you do not count their apparent victories as something significant, that you consider them temporary, and that you do not submit to them, because despair leads to submission. However, desire means that the emergence, despite its extraordinary aspects, does not occur in isolation; it is achieved with the help of a group of worthy and like-minded companions. The essence of desire is readiness.

A MAN WHOSE VALUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED LATER

Allama Tabatabai, may God sanctify his soul, is an incredibly great and valuable man. He is someone whose contributions will be analyzed and appreciated a hundred years from now. He was truly one of the greatest servants of Islam. He was the embodiment of piety and spirituality. He reached very high levels in self-purification and piety. I have benefited from the presence of this great man for many years, and I still do. His book Tafseer al-Mizan is one of the best commentaries on the Holy Quran. It is the best commentary written from the time of the Prophet until today, both within Shia and Sunni traditions. He was truly an extraordinary and esteemed man. Of course, his recognition is not limited to Iran; he is also well-known in the Islamic world. In Europe and America, he is regarded as a great thinker, and many seek his works and ideas. He has both an Islamic personality not just a Shiite personality and a global intellectual identity. This man was truly a person of great dignity and significance.

ADVICE ON PROPER READING HABITS

A person initially reads a book for pleasure. At this stage, they cannot make judgments about the content of the book. In the second round, even the strongest memory requires a person to read a useful book at least twice consecutively. After that, they analyze, categorize, and memorize the material, paying attention to which category each piece of information belongs to. It is a mistake to read a book like a form of entertainment and jump to another book or topic before the material has been properly absorbed and the mind has had time for analysis. For example, reading historical books today, psychology books tomorrow, and religious books the next day—this leads to a chaotic mess, like an untidy storage room. A mature person gathers books and materials they find necessary, repeatedly reads and categorizes them, then summarizes the information. The summary is noted down and memorized, after which they can move on to a new subject.

IF THE SOUL IS HEALTHY

If the human soul is healthy, when it encounters the truth, it should feel pleasure. If we reach the point where the truth becomes bitter for us, we must certainly recognize that we are seriously ill and in need of healing.

THE SELECT GROUP AT IMAM MAHDI'S APPEARANCE

In Islamic narrations, there is mention of a select group of individuals who, upon the appearance of Imam Mahdi, will join him. This indicates that not only has truth and righteousness not diminished to zero, but even if the number of the people of truth is not significant, they are, in terms of quality, the most valuable of the faithful and rank among the companions of the master of martyrs.

THE AHL AL-BAYT IN DAMASCUS RUINS

The Ahl al-Bayt of the Prophet were confined in a ruin, a four-walled enclosure without a roof, where they could not escape. They were locked in that space, and it had no other characteristic. The phrase "it neither protected them from the heat nor from the cold" is a description found in the writings of the historians of the battle. It is not clear exactly how long they stayed there, as it is not specified whether it was a few weeks, days, or months, but it is written that one day someone saw Imam Zayn al-Abidin outside the ruin. He noticed his face had peeled from the harsh conditions and asked him about it. Imam replied: "We are in a place that does not protect us from the heat nor the cold." The time spent by the Ahl al-Bayt in Damascus was extremely difficult for them. In a narration from Imam Zayn al-Abidin, when he was asked, "Which part of your journey was the hardest for you: from Karbala, to Kufa, on the way, from Kufa to Damascus, or from Damascus to Medina?" He replied: "Sham, Sham, Sham." Damascus was the hardest for us, and the main reason for that seems to have been the unique humiliation they faced in the court of Yazid. In Yazid's court, the utmost insults were inflicted upon them. Imam Zayn al-Abidin said: "We were twelve people, and we were bound together with a rope, one end tied to my arm and the other to my aunt Zaynab's. Despite this, we were brought into Yazid's court, with the full display of the pomp and ceremony he had arranged for his gathering."

IS IT PERMISSIBLE TO LIE FOR PILGRIMAGE

Sometimes in a society—when its education system is flawed—sensitivities arise regarding some recommended acts, where people abandon obligatory acts in favor of performing traditions, and sometimes sensitivities arise about minor disliked acts, where people sacrifice numerous forbidden acts for the sake of avoiding one makruh. Those responsible for the proper education of society must be mindful of these issues. Suppose we want to make a recommended pilgrimage to the shrine of Imam Hussein. Setting aside my personal belief—that the pilgrimage to Imam Hussein could, in certain circumstances, become obligatory because the value of visiting him and reviving his teachings might become so great that it reaches the level of an obligation—there are times when it remains merely a regular recommended act. In this case, if we are performing this regular pilgrimage and we want to travel to Karbala, there is no doubt that lying is forbidden in Islam. If we need to lie to get a visa for the pilgrimage, or tell lies while exchanging money, or tell multiple lies to carry out this visit, we cannot justify these lies by claiming they are permissible because they are done for the sake of religion. No, lying itself is forbidden, even if it is done under the pretext of religion. We must evaluate whether this recommended act of visiting Imam Hussein holds so much value in Islam that it justifies telling numerous lies, or not.

THE ERA OF OPPRESSION IS TEMPORARY

One of the fundamental advantages of Islamic beliefs—especially in the view of Shia Islam—is that we should not be pessimistic. The era of oppression, conflict, moral corruption, and darkness is a temporary phase. Ultimately, it will be followed by an era of enlightenment and justice.

CONSEQUENCES OF NEPOTISM IN PUNISHING CRIMINALS

During the conquest of Mecca, a woman committed a crime that required punishment. This woman, who had stolen, was from one of the noble and elite families of the Quraysh. When the time came to execute the punishment and cut off her hand, her family raised an outcry, saying, "How can we bear such shame?" They went collectively to the Prophet and requested him to forgive the woman. The Prophet replied: "I will never forgive her." Despite all the intercessors and mediators, the Prophet did not listen to them. Instead, he gathered the people and said: "Do you know why the previous nations were destroyed? It was because they practiced discrimination in such matters. If a criminal was not related to a noble family and had no intercessors, they would be punished quickly. But if the criminal had mediators, the law would not apply to them. This is why God destroyed such nations. I will never tolerate any discrimination against anyone."

WHY IMAM HASSAN MADE PEACE

During the time of Imam Hassan, due to many factors, particularly the weakness of his companions, if Imam Hassan had resisted, he would have been martyred, but not in the honorable and dignified way that Imam Hussein was martyred. Imam Hussein's martyrdom, along with his seventy-two companions, became a lasting symbol of dignity, and it continues to nourish Islam after 1300 years. During Imam Hassan's time, there was a sense of lethargy and fatigue among the Shia, and had he continued to resist against Muawiyah, there was a real danger that Imam Hassan would have been captured and delivered in chains to Muawiyah. At that time, Muawiyah and the Umayyads hadn't yet imposed their full power on the people. Muawiyah ruled for twenty years, and only after the oppression of figures like Mughira bin Shu'bah and Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan did people realize they had made a mistake by not supporting Imam Ali during his time. This understanding led to the formation of the Tawabin group after the tragedy of Karbala, the same group that later gathered around Mukhtar. Additionally, the situation with Yazid was very different from that of Muawiyah. Muawiyah worked under the guise of hypocrisy, whereas Yazid openly acted in disbelief. While Muawiyah at least concealed his actions, never drinking wine or openly engaging in immoral behavior, Yazid was reckless, drinking openly and even insulting the Prophet in public. In reality, had it not been for the events of Karbala, Islam would have been at risk of extinction. The conditions of the time were vastly different. Thus, both Imam Hassan and Imam Hussein executed the same plan; however, the form of their actions differed, but their underlying spirit was the same.

SIMPLICITY AND AVOIDING AFFECTATION

One of the key traits of Prophet Muhammad was that he lived a simple and unaffected life. He spoke simply, ate simply, and dressed simply, all while ensuring he was always clean, pure, and perfumed. Simplicity and avoiding pretentiousness were fundamental principles of his life. The Prophet did not allow his gatherings to have distinctions of rank or status. He particularly instructed that his companions sit in a circle, without any hierarchical arrangement, ensuring equality in the gathering. In general, an attachment to a life of affectation is a sign of a small spirit and lack of true character. Some individuals feel inferior and try to compensate for this by creating an artificial persona, seeking validation from others. These individuals often feel the need to display superficial status. On the other hand, those with true knowledge and character do not need to display titles or engage in pretensions.

GREAT INDIVIDUALS RECOGNIZED GRADUALLY

Great individuals are those who, while not creating a wave during their own time as they truly deserve, are gradually recognized in later times.

THE DAY ALLAMEH REALIZED HE HADN'T UNDERSTOOD ASFAR

Allameh Tabatabai said: In the early days when I studied Asfar, I worked hard, thought deeply, and analyzed extensively. Gradually, I started to develop the arrogance that even if the philosopher Mulla Sadra himself came, he wouldn't be able to analyze the content better than I did. Then, I went to my teacher, the late Ayatollah Qazi, who was a master in the path of spiritual development and mysticism. When he delved into the issue of existence, I suddenly realized that I hadn't understood a single word of Asfar until that moment. If anyone truly wishes to understand Hikmat-e-Muta'aliyah Transcendent Theosophy, they must also prepare their heart, soul, and spiritual foundation; otherwise, it will become "layers of darkness, one above another."

HOW CAN WE HOPE FOR GRACE WITHOUT GENEROSITY

Once, a man—may God bless him—who was known to be religious and meticulous in performing his obligatory duties, said to me: "I don't recall ever giving even a single qeran an old Iranian coin to a poor person unless it was obligatory upon me. Whatever was required, I gave—but if it wasn't required, I didn't. I have never given even ten shahis another old coin beyond what was religiously mandatory." I said to him: "And for this very reason, you should never expect any favor or grace from God. Is this how you intend to deal with God? If He were to treat you purely by the standard of justice, you shouldn't be surprised. When you show no generosity, how can you expect divine generosity from your Lord?" As the saying goes: "One who shows no mercy, will not be shown mercy."

KNOWLEDGE CAPTIVE TO THE POWERFUL

Never before in history has knowledge been as captive and subservient to the powerful as it is today. The top scholars and scientists of the world are among the most imprisoned and constrained people on earth.

THE STRANGE STORY OF SURAH YASIN AT THE GRAVE

The late Professor Ali Akbar Parvaresh recounts: While I was serving as the Deputy Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, one night I saw Martyr Professor Morteza Motahhari in a dream. He pointed out a female member of parliament to me and said: "Mr. Parvaresh, please look into this woman's issue." In the dream, I felt it was a serious and heavy matter—something that made me hesitate. But Martyr Motahhari stood behind me like a pillar, placing his hand on my back to keep me from backing away. The next day, I called in that parliament member and asked: "Madam, do you have a problem? If there's anything I can do to help, please tell me." She asked in surprise: "How do you know?" I replied: "Last night, I saw Martyr Motahhari may God bless him in a dream. He told me to help resolve your problem." As soon as I said that, she broke down in tears and wept for a long time. I told her: "Please step outside and return once you've calmed down and are able to talk." After a while, she returned and said: "The truth is, I've been struggling with a serious problem for some time now. I've become exhausted and don't know what to do anymore. It occurred to me that maybe I should go to Qom, visit Lady Fatimah al-Ma'sumah peace be upon her, and then recite Surah Yasin at the grave of Martyr Motahhari, hoping that his soul might help me and that, by the blessing of Surah Yasin, my issue might be resolved. Just last night, I recited Surah Yasin at his grave—and now he has appeared in your dream." Motivated by Martyr Motahhari's request, I tried very hard to help solve her problem. It was truly complex and difficult, and at times I was close to giving up. But I kept remembering that dream—how the martyr had placed his hand firmly on my back to keep me from withdrawing. By God's grace, the issue was finally resolved.

EVERY NATION HAS SHARED DESTINY

The Quran attributes a collective destiny, a shared record of deeds, intellect, actions, obedience, and disobedience to nations or communities. As it says: "Every nation has an appointed term; when their term comes, they can neither delay it nor advance it by a single hour." In Surah Al-Jathiyah, verse 28, it says: "Every nation will be called to its own record of deeds." This indicates that, just as individuals have their own books and records, nations also have collective records, and since communities act with will and choice, they too will be held accountable. And in Surah Al-An'am, verse 108, the Quran states: "We made the actions of every nation seem fair and beautiful to them." This verse shows that each nation has its own unique perception, understanding, and values—what one group considers beautiful or good may be seen as undesirable by another. The social atmosphere of a nation shapes the intellectual and moral taste of its people.

A NEW FORM OF SHIRK

One of the key aspects of honoring God's name—something frequently emphasized in the Quran—is not to associate anything else with His name. We are taught that every act should begin solely with the name of God. Now suppose someone, moved by religious zeal, says: "I want to begin by saying, 'In the name of God and the Prophet of God.'" Islam says: Don't do that. Do not place any other name beside God's. Or someone says: "As a Shi'a, I want to say: In the name of God and Amir al-Mu'minin Imam Ali." Even this is not permitted in Islam. Some people, driven by a surge of patriotism, say: "In the name of God and Iran." This is shirk. Others, moved by revolutionary zeal and people-centered ideologies, say things like: "In the name of the people," or "In the name of God and the people." This too is shirk. We have no right to go beyond what we've been commanded. If we're not even allowed to pair God's name with the Prophet's name at the start of an act, then how can we pair it with the land, the people, or national identity? Shirk manifests in new forms every day. Nothing and no one should ever be placed alongside God or at His level.

THE NATURE OF TRUTH

The nature of truth is such that doubt and questioning actually help clarify it. Doubt is the prelude to certainty, and hesitation is the first step in the ladder of investigation.

LACK OF PEACE DESPITE MATERIAL COMFORTS

Some people feel unsettled within themselves, they sense that they are not content, and they cannot find peace of mind. They realize that they do not feel at ease, they are withered and depressed. But the cause of this restlessness and despondency is unknown to them. They see that they have everything and all the means of living, yet they are not happy with their lives. These individuals must understand that they certainly have unmet spiritual needs; there is definitely a deficiency in their souls. Eventually, they must admit and surrender to this truth that faith is also one of our innate and natural needs, and in fact, the highest of our needs. When we reach the source of faith and meaning, when we witness God's light in our soul and spirit, then we will understand the meaning of happiness, joy, and contentment. The Holy Quran says: "Know that only through the remembrance of God and His remembrance does the soul find peace, and the heart finds tranquility." Imam Ali says: "God has made His remembrance the purification and illumination of hearts. Through this, ears open, eyes become clear, and hearts become obedient and calm."

MAN IS REPELLED BY WOMEN'S DEGRADATION

Contrary to what is initially assumed, man, deep in his soul, is repelled by the degradation of women and their submission and commodification. Man has always admired the dignity, self-sufficiency, and indifference of women toward himself.

THE MARTYRDOM OF IMAM JAWAD

The policies of the Abbasid Caliphs differed from those of the Umayyads. The Umayyads were more violent, but the Abbasids were more insidious, meaning they acted more politically and strategically, so only a few could truly understand their political moves. One of the tactics they used was to keep the Imams under surveillance. To do this, they would forcefully marry one of their daughters to them, saying, "You must marry this girl!" After the marriage, they would claim, "Our daughter and son-in-law must stay here with us!" This was done in such a way that the public wouldn't understand the severe surveillance, restrictions, and suffering imposed on the Imams. Eventually, it was under the command of the caliph, al-Mu'tasim, that Imam Jawad's wife, Umm al-Fadl, poisoned him in a very painful manner. Because it was clear that the caliph had ordered this, those who had poisoned the Imam were too fearful to bury his body. Mu'tasim even ordered that the Imam's body be thrown into the street. For two or three days, his body lay in the street, until it was reported to him that an extraordinary event had occurred. Normally, if a body is left exposed for three or four days, it begins to rot and become foul-smelling. But the body of Imam Jawad continued to emit a sweet fragrance, and if the people discovered this, it would cause a major scandal. This is why Mu'tasim reluctantly gave permission for the Imam's body to be buried. His sacred body was laid to rest next to his grandfather, Imam Musa al-Kadhim, in the famous shrine of Kadhimayn. In this regard, his situation bore resemblance to his noble grandfather, Imam Hussein, who was thrown into the desert, "thrown three times without washing or shrouding." There is no power and no strength except with Allah, the Almighty.

ANSWER TO A RIDDLE-LIKE QUESTION ABOUT GOD

There is a fascinating sentence in Du'a al-Iftitah a supplication recited in Ramadan: "He who is far, thus cannot be seen; and who is near, thus witnesses whispered conversations." It describes God as: "He who is far, thus cannot be seen; and who is near, thus witnesses whispered conversations." In reality, we are far from Him, but He is near to us. A paradox! How can two things have different states of proximity and distance toward one another? Yet in this case, it is possible: God is near to all things, while things are not near to God—they have different relational standings with Him. An insightful nuance in this sentence is the choice of attributes used. When God is described as distant, it refers to a human attribute: He cannot be seen. But when describing His closeness, it refers to a divine attribute: His awareness and presence. When it concerns our ability to perceive, He is described as distant; when it concerns His ability to know, He is described as close. Poet Saadi beautifully expressed this concept: "The Beloved is closer to me than I am to myself, Yet strangely, I am far from Him. What shall I do, to whom can I say, That the Friend is beside me, yet I am lonely?"

ONLY RELIGION CAN TAME THE COMMANDING SELF

The Holy Prophet Muhammad once sent a group of companions to battle. Upon their return, he welcomed them by saying: "Welcome to the group who has returned from the lesser struggle jihad al-asghar; the greater struggle jihad al-akbar still lies ahead." They asked, "What is the greater struggle, and where does it take place?" The Prophet replied: "It is the struggle against the self that commands to evil nafs al-ammārah." This hadith reveals a hidden war—an inner conflict—within the human being, a kind of internal battlefield between opposing forces of the soul. Psychologists say that certain internal factors cause a kind of disorder or disharmony between one's thoughts and emotions. That's why some individuals swing between piety and sinfulness—at times devoted to God, at other times careless and indulging in vice. Such people are neither complete believers nor total disbelievers—they live in a state of spiritual contradiction. We must strive to resolve this inner conflict—not through temporary truces, but by achieving genuine harmony between the various elements of the soul. And at this point, once again, we realize humanity's deep need for religion—for only true faith has the power to subdue and discipline the soul's rebellious tendencies. No other force or system has this transformative ability.

AN INSTRUCTIVE STORY FROM IMAM AL-BAQIR

Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir, one of the well-known ascetics and mystics of his time, narrates: "One extremely hot day, I had gone outside the city of Medina. Suddenly, I saw Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir, drenched in sweat and working hard under the blazing sun." He continues: "In my heart, I said to myself: Look at this noble man from Quraysh—how greed for the world has driven him to toil in such scorching heat! I thought it would be good to give him a word of advice. So I approached him, greeted him, and he replied with a strong voice. Then I said: You are a great figure from the Quraysh. Is it befitting for you to be out here in search of the world in this heat? What if death were to overtake you in this state? What answer would you have before God?" He says the Imam calmly listened, then replied: "By God, if death comes to me right now, it will have come to me while I am engaged in obedience to God. I am working to earn a livelihood so I will not need you or anyone else. I only fear death if it finds me while committing a sin." With this action and reasoning, Imam al-Baqir made it clear—not just to Ibn al-Munkadir but to all who might fall into such misunderstanding—that in Islam, working hard to earn a lawful living is not a sin, but rather an act of devotion and obedience to the Almighty.

SELLING PIETY KNOWLEDGE AND ART

He who sells his piety is not truly pious; He who sells his art is not truly an artist; And he who sells his knowledge is not truly a scholar.

CAN ONE ABANDON PRAYER FOR IMAM HUSSAIN

Don't imagine that turning to an intercessor shafīʿ, like Imam Hussain, means you can escape from the door of God! If that turn becomes a means of fleeing from God's presence, then it's a path straight to Hell. If someone says, "I won't pray, I'll just do something else for Imam Hussain," such a person has neither known God nor known Imam Hussain. Imam Hussain is the one who, in the early days of his uprising, stated: "God's pleasure is our pleasure, the Ahl al-Bayt's pleasure." Imam Hussain cannot be pleased with anything other than what God is pleased with. If the Prophet were to have an independent "shop"—wanting something different from what God wants, being satisfied with something God is not satisfied with—then he couldn't be a Prophet.

THE POVERTY OF MISERLY WEALTHY PEOPLE

The principles of life and the straight path—which the sacred line of prophets are the foremost and best guides for—are entirely different from this: that a person falls into the whirlpool of greed and madly chases wealth, without having a righteous and legitimate goal in mind. Such wealth-hoarding, beyond being a social sin violating the rights of the community, is also on an individual level nothing but a burden, a curse, and a source of misery and pain. Imam Ali said: There are some people who are astonishing—those who live like the poor because of their stinginess and miserliness, yet on the Day of Judgment, must give account like the rich: Where did you get your wealth? Why did you hoard it? Why didn't you spend it, or why did you spend it in falsehood? The strangest part is that the very poverty they fear comes to them sooner due to their miserliness, and the wealth and comfort they love, they grow further from it every day.

THE DUTY IN HASTENING ABSOLUTE JUSTICE

It is true that global justice is like a life-giving force and has a metaphysical dimension. However, until obstacles are removed, this life will not manifest. Therefore, it is the duty of the people to struggle against these obstacles in order to hasten the emergence of absolute justice. In other words, unless people become truly seekers of perfection and absolute justice— sincerely and accompanied by effort—they will not attain that lofty, metaphysical goal.

WHY ISLAM IS UNIVERSAL NOT LIMITED TO ARABS

There are verses in the Quran whose meaning implies a kind of "pride" or indifference toward the Arab people in terms of accepting Islam. The essence of these verses is that Islam does not need you; even if you do not accept Islam, there are other peoples in the world who will embrace Islam wholeheartedly. In fact, from these verses, it can be inferred that the Quran considers the spirit of those other peoples more suitable and prepared for Islam than that of the Arabs. These verses clearly indicate the universality of Islam. In Surah Al-An'am, verse 89, it says: "If they the Arabs reject it, We have entrusted it to a people who will not be disbelievers in it." Also, in Surah Muhammad, verse 38, it says: "And if you turn away, He will substitute for you a people other than you; then they will not be like you." From Islam's viewpoint, Arabs and non-Arabs are equal regarding acceptance or rejection of Islam, and in fact, Arabs were repeatedly reprimanded for their disregard toward Islam. Islam wants to make the Arabs understand that whether they believe or not, this religion will progress because Islam is not a religion brought for a specific people alone.

WHAT DOES LUSTFULNESS DO

Nobility, courage, and bravery of the spirit do not grow in everyone. Honor, freedom, the pursuit of justice, and being benevolent do not develop in all people. In a lustful and indulgent person, these qualities decline and deteriorate; but in a selfless person who is freed from bodily desires, they grow. Therefore, where a person is inclined toward lust, pleasure, and indulgence, all human virtues perish, and the person sinks into the mud of moral vices. For this reason, both the individual and society begin to fall into decline. The righteous saints even refrained from many permissible pleasures and avoided getting entangled even in lawful delights, because they knew that where a person becomes attached to pleasure, the exaltation of the spirit is taken away from him—let alone when he is attached to sin.

THE JOYFUL EXPERIENCE OF WITNESSING DIVINE GRACE

When a person's life is marked by the pursuit of truth, sincerity, action, and effort, it becomes supported by the Divine Reality. From unseen paths unknown to us, an invisible hand extends Divine care and support. This is not only a matter of faith and a requirement of believing in the teachings of the prophets—it is also a real, experiential truth, albeit a personal and individual one. Everyone must, at some point in life, walk this path to witness the effect of God's grace in their own lives. And how sweet it is to deal with God and to witness the manifestations of His mercy. It is not a very difficult task—its early stages are simple. A person can begin by serving others, helping the weak, especially showing kindness to their parents—with sincerity and pure intention. In this way, they will gradually see traces of God's mercy in their lives. I myself can claim that I have personally experienced this; I have tangibly felt God's kindness under such circumstances.

WHY DID PEOPLE IN THE WEST TURN AWAY FROM RELIGIOUS GOVERNMENT

In the history of political philosophy, when specific social and political concepts arose in the West — especially the issues of natural rights and the right of national sovereignty — some people became supporters of political absolutism. They denied any rights for the masses against the ruler and only attributed duties and obligations to the people. To justify their absolutist political theories, these people clung to the idea of God and claimed that the ruler is not accountable to the people but only to God, whereas the people are responsible and obligated toward the ruler. The people have no right to question or hold the ruler accountable for his actions, nor to assign duties to him. Only God can question or judge the ruler. Thus, people have no rights over the ruler, but the ruler has rights that people must fulfill. Consequently, an artificial and forced association arose in Western thought between belief in God and the necessity of submission to the ruler, surrendering any right to intervene against one whom God has chosen to protect and guard the people, and to whom the ruler is accountable solely to God. Similarly, an association arose between belief in national sovereignty and atheism. From the perspective of Islamic social philosophy, belief in God does not lead to acceptance of absolute rule by individuals, and the ruler is responsible to the people. Indeed, only belief in God makes the ruler accountable to society, grants rights to individuals, and defines the fulfillment of rights as a necessary religious duty. According to Islam, religious concepts have always equaled freedom — exactly the opposite of what has occurred in the West, where religious concepts have been equated with social oppression. It is clear that such a method will only drive people away from religion and push them toward materialism, antagonism toward religion and God, and everything associated with the divine.

AT IMAM'S APPEARANCE INTELLECTS WILL INCREASE

In the Hadith from Usul al-Kafi, it is stated that when Imam al-Hujjah may Allah hasten his reappearance appears, God Almighty will place His hand upon the heads of human beings, increasing their intellect; their thought and actions will multiply.

WHY NOT FORCE VOLUNTARY WORSHIP

The human spirit is extremely delicate and reacts quickly. If a person pressures their soul in doing something, the soul's reaction is to escape and avoid it. In worship, one of the Prophet's recommendations is to perform acts of worship only as long as your soul finds joy and willingness in them. That means you should worship with desire and eagerness. When you have prayed, performed voluntary acts, recited Quran, and stayed awake in devotion, but then feel the worship has become heavy and forced—that is the sign to stop. Don't force worship upon yourself. Because as soon as you impose it forcibly, your soul gradually becomes averse to worship, as if you gave it a bitter medicine. Then you will have a bad memory of worship. Always try to maintain joy in worship and keep your soul's memories of worship pleasant.
